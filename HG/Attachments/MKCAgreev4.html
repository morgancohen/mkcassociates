<p>MKC Associates LLC<br />
Property Inspection Agreement</p>
<p>1. General; Fees. This is an agreement between
____________________________ (the "Client") and MKC Associates LLC ("MKC"). The Client requests that MKC conduct a
property inspection of the premises located at
_______________________________________ (the "Property Inspection")
and prepare a property inspection report in connection with the
Property Inspection (the "Property Inspection Report"). The
Property Inspection shall take place on the ______ day of
_______________, 200___, and the Client requests that the Property
Inspection Report be prepared within 48 hours of the time of the
Property Inspection. The Client warrants that permission has been
obtained from the owner of the premises to be inspected. The client
agrees to pay at the time of the inspection a fee of $__________ to
MKC covering the Property Inspection and preparation of the
Property Inspection Report. Should the client fail to timely pay
the agreed upon fees in full, MKC may withhold the Property
Inspection Report.</p>
<p>2. Standards of Practice; Scope of Inspection. The Property
Inspection will be performed, and the Property Inspection Report
will be prepared, in accordance with the Massachusetts Standards of
Practice located at MA 266 CMR 1.00 - 11.00, which are incorporated
herein by reference and hereby made a part hereof (the
"Standards"). All terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meaning set forth in the Standards. The Standards can be
found at: http://www.mass.gov/dpl/boards/hi/cmr/26606.htm. The
website where the Standards can be found will also be provided in
the Property Inspection Report, and a hard copy of the Standards
will be provided to the client upon request. The Property
Inspection is meant to provide the client with a better
understanding of the condition of certain readily accessible
installed systems and components of the property at the time of the
Property Inspection. The Client understands that the Property
Inspection and Property Inspection Report are based on the visual
observations of the inspector of readily accessible areas and does
not include or report on inaccessible areas. In the event that the
inspector recommends that the Client consult with a pest control
contractor or other specialized expert(s), the Client must do so at
their own expense, assume all risks associated with a failure to
contact said pest control contractor or other specialized
expert(s), and the inspector and MKC shall not be responsible for
the work or recommendations of said pest control contractor or
other specialized expert(s). This Property Inspection Report is not
intended to be an inducement to encourage or discourage the
purchase or sale of the property and the conclusions and
recommendations of the inspector are only those contained in the
Property Inspection Report, not any oral remarks that may be made
by the inspector during the Property Inspection.</p>
<p>3. Exclusions. Please carefully read the exclusions set forth in
the Standards, because the Standards contain important information
regarding exclusions from the Property Inspection and Property
Inspection Report.</p>
<p>4. Warranties. There is no express or implied warranty of any
kind regarding the condition of the property or any of the items or
systems contained therein, or as to the future performance or
expected lifespan of any of the items or systems contained therein,
whether or not mentioned in the Property Inspection Report. This is
a limited inspection only, and this Agreement, the Property
Inspection and the Property Inspection Report do not constitute a
general warranty, an insurance policy, a certification or a
guarantee of any kind. Should the Client discover unfavorable
conditions that the Client suspects had been overlooked or not
reported on at the time of the Property Inspection, the Client
agrees to notify MKC within thirty (30) days of said discovery and
allow MKC access to the property to inspect said conditions.</p>
<p>5. Confidentiality. This Property Inspection is being performed,
and the Property Inspection Report is being prepared, for the
Client's sole, confidential and exclusive benefit and use, and may
not be transferred or assigned to any third party. If the Client
directly or indirectly allows or causes the Property Inspection
Report or any portion thereof to be disclosed or distributed to any
third party, the Client agrees to indemnify and hold the inspector
and MKC harmless from any and all losses, liabilities and related
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising
out of claims or actions based on the Property Inspection and/or
the Property Inspection Report brought by a third party or third
parties.</p>
<p>6. Arbitration. Any dispute concerning this Agreement or arising
from the Property Inspection or the Property Inspection Report
(unless based on the non-payment of fees) shall be resolved by
binding, non-appealable arbitration conducted in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties shall mutually agree upon one
(1) arbitrator who shall have at least ten (10) years experience in
the home inspection industry. The fees and expenses of arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be borne
by the party deemed responsible by the arbitrator except that, the
party filing for arbitration shall be responsible for all filing
fees. At the arbitration, the arbitrator may consider all claims
that would have been available to the parties in a court of law,
including, but not limited to, claims for lawful attorneys' fees
and multiple damages, where provided by statute. The Client hereby
acknowledges that participation in binding arbitration as provided
for herein is not intended to limit in any way the costs and
damages otherwise legally available to the Client.</p>
<p>7. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
among the parties and supersedes and nullifies all prior agreements
and understandings, express or implied, between the parties hereto
concerning the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be
modified or amended at any time and from time to time, but only by
a written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>8. Client's Responsibility. Pursuant to Section 6.03(4) of the
Standards, answers to the questions set forth on the Property
Questionnaire attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof should
be ascertained by you, the Client, from the Seller and/or the
Seller&rsquo;s Representative because they are important and
relevant to the purchase of the inspected dwelling and may not be
Readily Observable through inspection. There is no legal
obligation, duty, or requirement on behalf of the Seller and/or the
Seller&rsquo;s Representative to answer the questions set forth on
the Property Questionnaire. The Property Questionnaire will also be
attached to the Property Inspection Report</p>
<p>By signing below, I agree that I have read, understand and agree
to all the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement.</p>
