*reportinfo.inspectorCompany* to conduct a wind mitigation
inspection at the property address of
*reportinfo.fulladdress-oneline*. This inspection is limited to the

items in the report relating to stronger methods to resist wind
loads on the home in adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this inspection is to determine if certain
procedures have been performed on the home to help withstand
adverse conditions. It is not an assurance that this home will be
protected or whether it can withstand specific types of adverse
conditions. By having this limited inspection it may be determined
that your home can qualify for a reduced insurance rate but is not
a guarantee.</p>

mainly to satisfy requirements of an insurance company.</p>

Sincerely,</p>
