<br />
Explanation below:<br />
<br />
Your client contract agreement can be placed by you in one of the above files and it depends on how you want to use it in the report as to which file you should use. <br />
<br />
1. Disclaim File: If you place your contract agreement in the Disclaim file it will:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Automatically populate the customer info for you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Automatically insert the agreement in-line inside the report. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Use this Disclaim file if you plan to use the "Force Agreement" online at our uploaded report.<br />
<br />
2. Agreement File 1 or 2: If you place your client agreement in the "Agreement" File (1 or 2) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. You will select it each inspection under the MISC button in the software and click ATTACH.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When you have multiple contract agreements (i.e. Commercial, Mold etc) You will need to attach at each inspection (under MISC button) which file you want for that inspection.<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you choose "Disclaim" file for your commonly used agreement (preferred) then when you have an inspection requiring a different agreement and attach it under MISC button it will override the Disclaim file and the Disclaim file will not be used or displayed for that report, which is intentional as you are wanting a different agreement for that report. <br />
<br />
You must include your own agreement which is most likely different than others
  because of differences in state/local laws and what you are willing to inspect
  others may not. This 
means that you will need to put your wording on this page. This page is 
written in html code so your customer will be able to read it on the internet
   at your/our web site. Most inspectors do not know html code (including myself).
<p />
Several ways are available to get your pre-inspection agreement ready for HomeGauge. 
You can:
<ol>
	<li>Attach the agreement in Word (*.doc) or PDF format</li>
	<li>Use the MS Word feature of "File -> Save Web Page" to create overwrite this file.</li>
	<li>Continue to print your own as you have, and attach a copy to the report</li>
	<li>Edit this file yourself at My Documents\homegauge\html\agreement.html</li>
</ol>
<p />
Because of some state laws governing home inspectors the contract must be 
signed before you do the inspection. Your going to print this report on site 
and obviously it is printed after the inspection so the contract must have 
been signed prior. So by placing your contract on the web at your/our web 
site, your customer who is out of town can print it from our site and fax it 
back to you before the inspection. And the reason you still want to have this 
page on your computer is to print you a few copies of the contract prior to 
your inspections and have the buyer sign one of them before the inspection. 
And print their copy along with the report.<br />
