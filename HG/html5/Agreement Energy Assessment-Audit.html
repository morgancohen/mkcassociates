Agreement</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">This contract is an agreement between the client
listed below, and *reportinfo.inspector* D/B/A
*reportinfo.inspectorCompany*, to perform an energy asessment of
the home or building listed below according to energy guidelines.
This assessment is a limited visual inspection and involves
diagnostic testing with equipment when stated in the report. Areas
that are inaccessible are not part of this assessment. The
assessment may also involve drilling a small hole or holes in
certain walls to discover the materials used to help determine the
R-value of the wall. These holes (usually 2 inches in diameter)
will then be capped or plugged and will remain visible to the eye
as a test hole plugged or capped. Usually this is done in a closet
to minimize its asthetic importance. The Customer assumes all risk
for problems noted in this report that may reveal further damage
during a repair or further investigation by a qualified
professional that may reveal a difference in opinion contray to
that of my company performing the assessment.. Your signature below
is your acceptance of these terms and conditions. While we may
point out any safety issues or the condition of "durability" as it
relates to energy performance of a particular component or
material, it is not meant to imply that other areas in the home
that are either dangerous or the compromise of durability may be
present. This energy assessment is NOT a home inspection, or a
safety inspection. Hazards or conditions that affect the durability
of the home may be present and not included in this
report.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The purpose and scope of this energy assessment
is to provide you with a better understanding of the property's
condition from an energy efficiency standpoint and suggest areas
and steps to take to increase energy performance of this home or
building.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><u>Our energy assessment does not include the
inspection or any part of testing or determining whether or not
these conditions exist such as</u>:</b> Asbestos, Formaldehyde,
Mold or Fungi, or bio-aerosols. Soil or geological conditions.

condition of building components</font><font size="2">. We are not
responsible to determine all that may be wrong with a system or
component as we perform certain tests relating to energy
performance. Troubleshooting from other contractors may reveal
additional items not mentioned in this report. Any item mentioned
in the report may need inspections by other qualified specialists
not included in this report. We are not responsible for items
mentioned in this report. We are not a guarantee nor do we
guarantee any items or opinions described on this report. This
energy assessment is an attempt to find energy deficiency and
recommend steps to correct. It is understood that other energy
contractors may disagree, or recommend different strategies to
correct or improve the homes efficiency. We are not a home warranty
company nor do we carry insurance on warranty claims. The limited
liability of the energy company and its representative to the
Client, spouse, executors or heirs or administrators are limited to
a refund of the fee paid for the energy assessment and
report.</font></p>
