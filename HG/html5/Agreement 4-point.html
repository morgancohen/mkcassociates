4 Point Inspection</p>
<p><br />
This agreement is between *client.fname1* *client.lname1* and
*reportinfo.inspectorCompany* to conduct a 4 point inspection at
the property address of *reportinfo.address1* *reportinfo.address2*
*reportinfo.city*, *reportinfo.state* *reportinfo.zip*. This
inspection is limited to the inspection items in the report and is
not a full home inspection. The purpose of the 4 point inspection
is a cursory "glance" at some of the main components of the home
for current working condition and is not considered an exhaustive
inspection or an evaluation of the life expectancy of any
component. Deficiencies may exist in the home and is not intended
to be discovered with this type of inspection. For a more detailed
inspection of the home and it's components it is strongly
recommended the customer consider a full home inspection. By
signing this agreement you understand it is a limited inspection
mainly to satisfy requirements of an insurance company.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br />
