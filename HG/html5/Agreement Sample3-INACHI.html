<p>The address of the property is: *reportinfo.address1*
*reportinfo.address2* *reportinfo.city* *reportinfo.state*
*reportinfo.zip*</p>
<p>Fee for the home inspection is $*reportinfo.price*. INSPECTOR
acknowledges receiving a deposit of $ from CLIENT.</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT made on *reportinfo.date* by and between
*reportinfo.inspector* (Hereinafter &#8220;INSPECTOR&#8221;) and
the undersigned (hereinafter &#8220;CLIENT&#8221;), collectively
referred to herein as &#8220;the parties.&#8221; The Parties
Understand and Voluntarily Agree as follows:</p>
<p>1. INSPECTOR agrees to perform a visual inspection of the
home/building and to provide CLIENT with a written inspection
report identifying the defects that INSPECTOR both observed and
deemed material. INSPECTOR may offer comments as a courtesy, but
these comments will not comprise the bargained-for report. The
report is only supplementary to the seller&#8217;s
disclosure.<br />
2. Unless otherwise inconsistent with this Agreement or not
possible, INSPECTOR agrees to perform the inspection in accordance
to the current Standards of Practice of the National Association of
Certified Home Inspectors posted at <a href=
"http://www.nachi.org/sop.htm">http://www.nachi.org/sop.htm</a>.
CLIENT understands that these standards contain certain
limitations, exceptions, and exclusions.<br />
3. The inspection and report are performed and prepared for the use
of CLIENT, who gives INSPECTOR permission to discuss observations
with real estate agents, owners, repairpersons, and other
interested parties. INSPECTOR accepts no responsibility for use or
misinterpretation by third parties. INSPECTOR&#8217;S inspection of
the property and the accompanying report are in no way intended to
be a guarantee or warranty, express or implied, regarding the
future use, operability, habitability or suitability of the
home/building or its components. Any and all warranties, express or
implied, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose, are expressly excluded by this Agreement.<br />
4. INSPECTOR assumes no liability for the cost of repair or
replacement of unreported defects or deficiencies either current or
arising in the future. CLIENT acknowledges that the liability of
INSPECTOR, its agents, employees, for claims or damages, costs of
defense or suit, attorney&#8217;s fees and expenses and payments
arising out of or related to the INSPECTOR&#8217;S negligence or
breach of any obligation under this Agreement, including errors and
omissions in the inspection or the report, shall be limited to
liquidated damages in an amount equal to the fee paid to the
INSPECTOR, and this liability shall be exclusive. CLIENT waives any
claim for consequential, exemplary, special or incidental damages
or for the loss of the use of the home/building even if the CLIENT
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The parties
acknowledge that the liquidated damages are not intended as a
penalty but are intended (i) to reflect the fact that actual
damages may be difficult and impractical to ascertain; (ii) to
allocate risk among the INSPECTOR and CLIENT; and (iii) to enable
the INSPECTOR to perform the inspection at the stated fee.<br />
5. INSPECTOR does not perform engineering, architectural, plumbing,
or any other job function requiring an occupational license in the
jurisdiction where the inspection is taking place, unless the
inspector holds a valid occupational license, in which case he/she
may inform the CLIENT that he/she is so licensed, and is therefore
qualified to go beyond this basic home inspection, and for
additional fee, perform additional inspections beyond those within
the scope of the basic home inspection. Any agreement for such
additional inspections shall be in a separate writing or noted
here:
________________________________________________________________________________.</p>
<p>6. In the event of a claim against INSPECTOR, CLIENT agrees to
supply INSPECTOR with the following: (1) Written notification of
adverse conditions within 14 days of discovery, and (2) Access to
the premises. Failure to comply with the above conditions will
release INSPECTOR and its agents from any and all obligations or
liability of any kind.<br />
7. The parties agree that any litigation arising out of this
Agreement shall be filed only in the Court having jurisdiction in
the County in which the INSPECTOR has its principal place of
business. In the event that CLIENT fails to prove any adverse
claims against INSPECTOR in a court of law, CLIENT agrees to pay
all legal costs, expenses and fees of INSPECTOR in defending said
claims.<br />
8. If any court declares any provision of this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. This
Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties. All
prior communications are merged into this Agreement, and there are
no terms or conditions other than those set forth herein. No
statement or promise of INSPECTOR or its agents shall be binding
unless reduced to writing and signed by INSPECTOR. No change or
modification shall be enforceable against any party unless such
change or modification is in writing and signed by the parties.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable by the parties
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assignees. CLIENT shall have no cause of action against INSPECTOR
after one year from the date of the inspection.<br />
9. Payment of the fee to INSPECTOR (less any deposit noted above)
is due upon completion of the on-site inspection. The CLIENT agrees
to pay all legal and time expenses incurred in collecting due
payments, including attorney&#8217;s fees, if any. If CLIENT is a
corporation, LLC, or similar entity, the person signing this
Agreement on behalf of such entity does personally guaranty payment
of the fee by the entity.<br />
10. HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT: CLIENT agrees to hold any and all real
estate agents involved in the purchase of the property to be
inspected harmless and keep them exonerated from all loss, damage,
liability or expense occasioned or claims by reason of acts or
neglects of the INSPECTOR or his employees or visitors or of
independent contractors engaged or paid by INSPECTOR for the
purpose of inspecting the subject home.<br />
CLIENT HAS CAREFULLY READ THE FOREGOING, AGREES TO IT, AND
ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
