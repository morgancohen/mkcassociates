<p style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;"align="center"> PURPOSE, LIMITATIONS AND INSPECTOR / CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES </p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">This property inspection report may include an inspection agreement (contract), addenda, and other information related to 
  property conditions. If any item or comment is unclear, you should ask the inspector to clarify the findings. It is important that 
  you carefully read ALL of this information.  </p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">This inspection is subject to the rules (&ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) of the Texas Real Estate Commission (&ldquo;TREC&rdquo;), which can be found at <a href="http://www.trec.texas.gov"> www.trec.texas.gov</a>.</p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">The TREC Standards of Practice (Sections 535.227-535.233 of the Rules) are the minimum standard for inspections by TREC Licensed inspectors.  An inspection addresses only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at 
the time of the inspection. While there may be other parts, components or systems present, only those items specifically noted 
as being inspected were inspected. The inspector is NOT required to turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utility 
services or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance. The inspector is NOT required to climb over obstacles, 
move furnishings or stored items. The inspection report may address issues that are code-based or may refer to a particular 
code; however, this is NOT a code compliance inspection and does NOT verify compliance with manufacturer’s installation 
instructions. The inspection does NOT imply insurability or warrantability of the structure or its components. Although some 
safety issues may be addressed in this report, this inspection is NOT a safety/code inspection, and the inspector is NOT required 
to identify all potential hazards.</p>
  
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify"> In this report, the inspector shall indicate, by checking the appropriate boxes on the form, whether each item was inspected, not 
inspected, not present or deficient and explain the findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form. The 
inspector must check the Deficient (D) box if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a 
system or component or constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the TREC Standards of Practice. General 
deficiencies include inoperability, material distress, water penetration, damage, deterioration, missing components, and 
unsuitable installation. Comments may be provided by the inspector whether or not an item is deemed deficient. The inspector 
is not required to prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another.</p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">Some items reported may be considered life-safety upgrades to the property. For more information, refer to Texas Real Estate 
Consumer Notice Concerning Recognized Hazards or Deficiencies below. </p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">THIS PROPERTY INSPECTION IS NOT A TECHNICALLY EXHAUSTIVE INSPECTION OF THE STRUCTURE, 
SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS. The inspection may not reveal all deficiencies. A real estate inspection helps to reduce some 
of the risk involved in purchasing a home, but it cannot eliminate these risks, nor can the inspection anticipate future events or 
changes in performance due to changes in use or occupancy. It is recommended that you obtain as much information as is 
available about this property, including any seller’s disclosures, previous inspection reports, engineering reports, 
building/remodeling permits, and reports performed for or by relocation companies, municipal inspection departments, lenders, 
insurers, and appraisers. </p>

</div>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">You should also attempt to determine whether repairs, renovation, remodeling, additions, or other 
such activities have taken place at this property. It is not the inspector’s responsibility to confirm that information obtained 
from these sources is complete or accurate or that this inspection is consistent with the opinions expressed in previous or future 
reports. </p>

  
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">ITEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT DO NOT OBLIGATE ANY PARTY TO MAKE REPAIRS OR TAKE OTHER 
ACTIONS, NOR IS THE PURCHASER REQUIRED TO REQUEST THAT THE SELLER TAKE ANY ACTION. When a 
deficiency is reported, it is the client’s responsibility to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service 
professionals. Any such follow-up should take place prior to the expiration of any time limitations such as option periods. </p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">Evaluations by qualified tradesmen may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies which may involve additional repair 
costs. Failure to address deficiencies or comments noted in this report may lead to further damage of the structure or systems 
and add to the original repair costs. The inspector is not required to provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs 
have been made.</p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">Property conditions change with time and use. For example, mechanical devices can fail at any time, plumbing gaskets and 
seals may crack if the appliance or plumbing fixture is not used often, roof leaks can occur at any time regardless of the 
apparent condition of the roof, and the performance of the structure and the systems may change due to changes in use or 
occupancy, effects of weather, etc. These changes or repairs made to the structure after the inspection may render information 
contained herein obsolete or invalid. This report is provided for the specific benefit of the client named above and is based on 
observations at the time of the inspection. If you did not hire the inspector yourself, reliance on this report may provide 
incomplete or outdated information. Repairs, professional opinions or additional inspection reports may affect the meaning of 
the information in this report. It is recommended that you hire a licensed inspector to perform an inspection to meet your 
specific needs and to provide you with current information concerning this property.</p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; font-weight:bold" align="center">TEXAS REAL ESTATE CONSUMER NOTICE CONCERNING HAZARDS OR DEFICIENCIES </p>
 <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">
Each year, Texans sustain property damage and are injured by accidents in the home. While some accidents may not be 
avoidable, many other accidents, injuries, and deaths may be avoided through the identification and repair of certain hazardous 
conditions. Examples of such hazards include: 
<ul style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
<li>malfunctioning, improperly installed, or missing ground fault circuit protection (GFCI) devices for electrical 
receptacles in garages, bathrooms, kitchens, and exterior areas;</li>
<li>malfunctioning arc fault protection (AFCI) devices; </li>
<li>ordinary glass in locations where modern construction techniques call for safety glass; </li> 
<li>malfunctioning or lack of fire safety features such as smoke alarms, fire-rated doors in certain locations, and 
functional emergency escape and rescue openings in bedrooms;</li>
<li> malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarms; </li>
<li> excessive spacing between balusters on stairways and porches; </li>
<li> improperly installed appliances; </li>
<li> improperly installed or defective safety devices;</li>
<li> lack of electrical bonding and grounding; and </li>
<li> lack of bonding on gas piping, including corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST).</li>
</ul></p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">
To ensure that consumers are informed of hazards such as these, the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) has adopted 
Standards of Practice requiring licensed inspectors to report these conditions as “Deficient” when performing an inspection for 
a buyer or seller, if they can be reasonably determined. 
</p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">
These conditions may not have violated building codes or common practices at the time of the construction of the home, or 
they may have been “grandfathered” because they were present prior to the adoption of codes prohibiting such conditions. 
While the TREC Standards of Practice do not require inspectors to perform a code compliance inspection, TREC considers the 
potential for injury or property loss from the hazards addressed in the Standards of Practice to be significant enough to warrant 
this notice. </p>
<p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align="justify">
Contract forms developed by TREC for use by its real estate licensees also inform the buyer of the right to have the home 
inspected and can provide an option clause permitting the buyer to terminate the contract within a specified time. Neither the 
Standards of Practice nor the TREC contract forms require a seller to remedy conditions revealed by an inspection. The 
decision to correct a hazard or any deficiency identified in an inspection report is left to the parties to the contract for the sale 
or purchase of the home. 
 </p>
