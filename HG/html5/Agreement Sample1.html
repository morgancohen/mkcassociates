*reportinfo.inspectorCompany*, to perform an inspection of the home
or building listed below according to the "Standards of Practice"
of <font color="#FF0000"><strong>Enter Assoc or Licensing Board of
that state</strong></font>. These standards of practice inform you
of what a home inspector should report, and what is not expected of
the home inspector to report. This inspection is a limited visual
inspection as a generalist. Areas that are inaccessible are not
part of this inspection including but not limited to: behind walls,
furniture, under rugs, inaccessible areas and below soil. The

The Client assumes all risk for problems noted in this report that
may reveal further damage during a repair or further investigation
by a qualified professional. Your signature (by pen or
electronically), is your acceptance of these terms and conditions.
A home inspection is not technically exhaustive and the inspector
does not dismantle or perform testing that is destructive. The
inspector is limited by this inspection agreement and cannot be
expected to find or discover all defects in this building.<br />
<br /></font><font size="2">The purpose and scope of this
inspection is to provide you with a better understanding of the

or fair, may be different than yours. You are encouraged to be
present at the time of your inspection so we will <u>both</u> have
an understanding of each others perception. The client accepts
responsibility for incomplete information if the Client did not
attend the inspection. Our purpose is to determine whether or not a
system or component (electrical, heating, visible structure etc) is
functioning for which it was intended. We are not responsible to
determine all that may be wrong with that system or component, just
whether or not a second opinion is needed, such as a licensed
electrician or HVAC contractor, or any specialist for that field or
trade. They determine what steps are necessary to correct. Their
troubleshooting may reveal additional items not mentioned in this
report. Any item mentioned in the report may need additional
inspections by other qualified specialists. It is up to the Client
who will be the person signing this contract to seek qualified
specialists to investigate further any item or component that is
commented on in the inspection report before closing. We are not
responsible for items mentioned in this report. We are not a
guarantee nor do we guarantee any items or opinions described on
this report. This inspection is to reduce the risk of finding a
potential problem, not to eliminate them. We are not a home

a one year home warranty which is not part of this agreement. The
