<h1 align="center">TEXAS REAL ESTATE CONSUMER NOTICE<br />
CONCERNING<br />
HAZARDS OR DEFICIENCIES</h1>
<p style="font-size:12px">Each year, Texans sustain property damage and are injured by accidents in the home.
While some accidents may not be avoidable, many other accidents, injuries, and deaths
may be avoided through the identification and repair of certain hazardous conditions.
Examples of such hazards include:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li style="font-size:12px">improperly installed or missing ground fault circuit protection (GFCI) devices for electrical receptacles in garages, bathrooms, kitchens, and exterior areas;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">improperly installed or missing arc fault protection (AFCI) devices for electrical receptacles in family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreations rooms, closets, hallways, or similar rooms or areas;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">ordinary glass in locations where modern construction techniques call for safety glass;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">the lack of fire safety features such as smoke alarms, fire-rated doors in certain locations, and functional emergency escape and rescue openings in bedrooms;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">excessive spacing between balusters on stairways and porches;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">improperly installed appliances;</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">improperly installed or defective safety devices; and</li>
	<li style="font-size:12px">lack of electrical bonding and grounding.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:12px">To ensure that consumers are informed of hazards such as these, the Texas Real Estate
Commission (TREC) has adopted Standards of Practice requiring licensed inspectors to
report these conditions as "Deficient" when performing an inspection for a buyer or seller,
if they can be reasonably determined.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">These conditions may not have violated building codes or common practices at the time
of the construction of the home, or they may have been "grandfathered" because they
were present prior to the adoption of codes prohibiting such conditions. While the TREC
Standards of Practice do not require inspectors to perform a code compliance inspection,
TREC considers the potential for injury or property loss from the hazards addressed in the
Standards of Practice to be significant enough to warrant this notice.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">Contract forms developed by TREC for use by its real estate licensees also inform the
buyer of the right to have the home inspected and can provide an option clause
permitting the buyer to terminate the contract within a specified time. Neither the
Standards of Practice nor the TREC contract forms requires a seller to remedy conditions
revealed by an inspection. The decision to correct a hazard or any deficiency identified in
an inspection report is left to the parties to the contract for the sale or purchase of the
home.</p>
<p style="border:thin #000000 solid; padding:5px 5px 5px 5px; font-size:12px">This form has been approved by the Texas Real Estate Commission for voluntary use by its licensees. Copies of TREC
rules governing real estate brokers, salesperson and real estate inspectors are available at nominal cost from TREC.
