<p><div class="gen-intro"><p align="center"><strong>READING THIS REPORT</strong></p><p>Please read through this entire report and contact us with any questions at all.</p><p>All comments, observations, and recommendations in this report should be considered before purchasing this home. Recommendations to repair or replace or for further investigation suggest a second opinion and/or further inspection by a qualified contractor or specialist.&#160;Costs associated with further inspection and repair or replacement should be considered <strong><em>prior to</em></strong> signing a purchase and sale agreement for the property (and before the expiration of the inspection contingency period). <strong><em>Please read this report carefully including embedded internet links and/or attachments. </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Photographs in this report are representative of condition(s) that may also be found in other areas in the property.</em></strong>&#160;Not all comments will have a photograph of the defect or problem. The presence or absence of a photograph has no bearing on the significance of the condition observed. See comments for complete descriptions of defects or problems. Designations in the report (right, left, front, back, etc.) are to be interpreted as from the front of the property, facing the building, unless otherwise stated in the comment.</p><p align="center"><strong>COMMENTS IN THIS REPORT</strong></p><p><strong>Inspected:</strong> The inspector visually observed the item, component or unit. It is performing its primary function and may have normal wear and tear for its age and use.</p><p><strong>Action Item:</strong>&#160; Action is recommended, and exact nature of issue is described in the comment that follows. </p><p><strong>(RR) Repair or Replace: </strong>The component or system is not functioning as intended and requires repair. Components or systems that can be repaired to satisfactory condition may not need replacement. It is recommended that you have this component and scope of the repair evaluated and repaired by the appropriate qualified specialist.</p><p><strong>(LI) Limited Inspection:</strong> Inspection of this component is limited or not possible. Inspection may be limited due to lack of visibility or access, weather, or other conditions. These conditions can sometimes conceal a defect in a component. Conditions causing these limitations should be corrected now and inspection or testing be made possible.</p><p><strong>(FI) Further Investigation:</strong> Further investigation of this component should be made now by the appropriate specialist, with the entire scope of necessary repairs determined, and repairs made as needed. This may also be indicated because the testing of this item is beyond the scope of the home inspection, or that there may be additional damage or related defect(s) that are concealed. Items marked with this comment may also require repair or replacement if found to be defective or if other problems are discovered.</p><p><strong>(FR) Future Repair:</strong> This item is currently functioning, but may fail or require significant repair or replacement in the very near to medium term. You should anticipate that this item will need repair or replacement at any time. It is not possible to predict any components' lifespan or remaining service life. Components or systems can fail, and sometimes without warning.</p><p><strong>(MR) Maintenance or Minor Repair:</strong> This item requires minor or cosmetic repair. A maintenance or minor repair item can become a serious problem or can lead to other deficiencies if not repaired or corrected.</p><p><strong>(NP) Not Present:</strong> This component is not present on the property. </p><p>When repairs or further investigation are recommended, the suggested contractor or professional is indicated in [brackets].</p><p align="center"><strong>ABOUT THIS INSPECTION</strong></p><p>This inspection was performed in accordance with and under the terms of our <a href="http://www.mkchomeinspection.com/agreement.html">Property Inspection agreement</a>. The inspection was also conducted in accordance with the Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/dpl/boards/hi/cmr/26606.htm">Standards of Practice</a> for Home Inspectors (MA regulations 266 CMR), and <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ocaterminal&amp;L=6&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Licensee&amp;L2=Division+of+Professional+Licensure+Boards&amp;L3=Board+of+Registration+of+Home+Inspectors&amp;L4=Statutes+and+Regulations&amp;L5=Rules+and+Regulations+Governing+Home+Inspectors&amp;sid=Eoca&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dpl_boards_hi_cmr_266cmr200&amp;csid=Eoca">definitions</a> of terms used in this report are included in these regulations. You should also be aware that there are <a href="http://www.mkchomeinspection.com/documents/propquestion.pdf">questions</a> you may ask of the seller regarding this property. These four documents are also attached to this report.&#160; <strong><em>Please keep in mind that this is not an architectural or engineering study of the structure, and it is not a code inspection. We do not inspect for, quote, or enforce building codes.</em></strong></p><p>When inspecting components such as cabinets, doors, windows, or testing receptacles and other components where there are multiple similar components, <strong><em>a representative number</em></strong> of these items is tested and/or inspected. Conditions observed for these components may be present on multiple other components in the home. All permanently installed appliances are tested except: microwaves, trash compactors and laundry machines. It is recommended that you refer to the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/">Consumer Products Safety Commission</a> for information about product recalls and general safety of appliances.</p><p>While this is a comprehensive analysis of the property, please keep in mind that no house is perfect. All properties have conditions that require repair and correction, as well as ongoing maintenance. Also please keep in mind that there is a possibility of hidden or concealed damage in areas of the home that we will not be able to see because this inspection is limited to accessible areas.</p><p>A note about mold and indoor air quality: <strong><em>We do not inspect for or test mold or indoor air quality. </em></strong><strong>We will indicate if we observe staining that appears to be mold. We also recommend that you have any suspect material tested for type and toxicity by a qualified indoor air quality specialist. </strong><strong><em>If you have any concerns about mold or allergies to mold, it is recommended that you consult with an indoor air quality specialist to test for mold.</em></strong><strong> If there are areas where there is water and/or moisture infiltration into the building, this is considered a conducive condition for mold growth, and there may be mold present in areas not accessible or visible. Further investigation into concealed areas is recommended in these cases, and any suspect material found should be tested and mitigated as necessary.</strong></p><p>Please also see the attached Home Maintenance, Safety and Efficiency Upgrade sheet. This is intended as a guide to assist you in maintaining your home on a regular basis, adding additional safety features that may not already be present in your home, and upgrading your home to operate more efficiently, resulting in lower utility costs.</p><p align="center"><strong>ADDITIONAL NOTES</strong></p><p>In a Massachusetts residential real estate transaction, Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detectors must be present in the home at the time of transfer of ownership. Installation of detectors in required locations if missing, and verification of all detectors in the home is the responsibility of the seller of the property. Inspection and testing of these units must be completed by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department, and coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in residential structures with enclosed parking or combustion heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&#160;and in common areas as well as bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at: <a href="http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm">http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm</a> It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications. UL information can be found at: <a href="http://www.ul.com/consumers/smoke.html">http://www.ul.com/consumers/smoke.html</a> and <a href="http://www.ul.com/consumers/co.html">http://www.ul.com/consumers/co.html</a></p><p>We do not verify property lines, setbacks, rights of way, deeded accesses, property usage types, property development restrictions, flood zone areas, wetlands, or any other zoning or land use ordinances. It is recommended that you obtain a survey of the property as well as a municipal plot plan. Historical information about the property may also be useful. Check with the local municipal building department to review the file on this property for any permits that have been pulled for work on the property. If work has been completed on this property that requires a permit that was never obtained, or that has a permit that has not been signed off on, then it may result in added costs and responsibility to you.<br /><br />If you make repairs or improvements to this property, use proper personal protection, safe practices, and obtain all necessary permitting for such work. All repairs that you make or contract for this property should comply with applicable requirements of the governing codes and sound construction practices.</div></p>

			The roof of the home was inspected and reported on with the above information. While the inspector makes every effort to find all areas of concern, some areas can go unnoticed. Roof coverings and skylights can appear to be without leaks during inspection and weather conditions. The inspector makes an attempt to find leaks or evidence of leaks but sometimes cannot. Roofs can leak at any time and sometimes without warning.			</div>

Please see the embedded Standards of Practice and Definitions (MA 266 CMR) at the end of this report for the complete description of the scope of the inspection of this system. Accessible areas of the structure will be inspected and probed where possible. Please keep in mind that finished walls, ceilings, floors, and inaccessible areas prevents inspection of structural members in these areas. Crawlspaces and attics will be entered if clearance is over 30 inches and if deemed safe for access by the inspector. Attics without flooring can be dangerous to access and will only be entered if deemed safe for access by the inspector. Attics with insulation covering structural members cannot be accessed because framing is not visible or accessible. Keep in mind that damage or defects may be present in areas not accessible.</div>

Please see the embedded Standards of Practice and Definitions (MA 266 CMR) at the end of this report for the complete description of the scope of the inspection of this system. Keep in mind that older homes may have piping in varying degrees of wear. Leakage may be present in concealed areas and may not be able to be detected if no visible signs are present. Also keep in mind that aged waste piping may require periodic maintenance clearing or replacement. Additionally, if this property has a private septic and/or a private well, inspection of these components is not included in this inspection. Septic systems will require a Title 5 inspection and private wells should have a well inspection, well test, and a comprehensive water quality test performed.</div>

			The plumbing in the home was inspected and reported on with the above information. While the inspector makes every effort to find all areas of concern, some areas can go unnoticed. The washing machine drain line, for example, cannot be checked for leaks or the ability to handle the volume during drain cycle. Older homes with galvanized supply lines or cast iron drain lines can be obstructed and barely working during an inspection and then fail under heavy use. If the water is turned off or not used for periods of time (such as&#160;a vacant home waiting for closing) rust or deposits within the pipes can further clog the piping system.			</div>

Please see the embedded Standards of Practice and Definitions (MA 266 CMR) at the end of this report for the complete description of the scope of the inspection of this system. Insulation will be inspected where visible. It is not possible to verify the presence of insulation in areas that are not visible. Also, keep in mind that old insulation materials may settle or shift in the walls, resulting in a reduction of efficiency in this insulation. Old insulation materials may contain asbestos. If you do work on the home, and any suspect materials are found in the walls or ceilings, they should be tested prior to disturbing or removing them.</div>

<div class="introtext">
Please see the embedded Standards of Practice and Definitions (MA 266 CMR) at the end of this report for the complete description of the scope of the inspection of this system. Cracking to walls in homes is sometimes a result of settlement, shifting, or sagging to structural members, but also may be a result of shrinkage to paint, wall compound or caulking. When inspecting, we are seeing the surfaces of the walls and ceilings as a &quot;snapshot&quot; and not over a period of time. Cracking may need monitoring to determine if any ongoing movement or settlement is occurring. Windows and doors are operated where accessible, and a representative number are tested.</div>

<p>MKC Associates LLC<br />
Property Inspection Agreement</p>
<p>1. General; Fees. This is an agreement between
____________________________ (the "Client") and MKC Associates LLC ("MKC"). The Client requests that MKC conduct a
property inspection of the premises located at
_______________________________________ (the "Property Inspection")
and prepare a property inspection report in connection with the
Property Inspection (the "Property Inspection Report"). The
Property Inspection shall take place on the ______ day of
_______________, 200___, and the Client requests that the Property
Inspection Report be prepared within 48 hours of the time of the
Property Inspection. The Client warrants that permission has been
obtained from the owner of the premises to be inspected. The client
agrees to pay at the time of the inspection a fee of $__________ to
MKC covering the Property Inspection and preparation of the
Property Inspection Report. Should the client fail to timely pay
the agreed upon fees in full, MKC may withhold the Property
Inspection Report.</p>
<p>2. Standards of Practice; Scope of Inspection. The Property
Inspection will be performed, and the Property Inspection Report
will be prepared, in accordance with the Massachusetts Standards of
Practice located at MA 266 CMR 1.00 - 11.00, which are incorporated
herein by reference and hereby made a part hereof (the
"Standards"). All terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meaning set forth in the Standards. The Standards can be
found at: http://www.mass.gov/dpl/boards/hi/cmr/26606.htm. The
website where the Standards can be found will also be provided in
the Property Inspection Report, and a hard copy of the Standards
will be provided to the client upon request. The Property
Inspection is meant to provide the client with a better
understanding of the condition of certain readily accessible
installed systems and components of the property at the time of the
Property Inspection. The Client understands that the Property
Inspection and Property Inspection Report are based on the visual
observations of the inspector of readily accessible areas and does
not include or report on inaccessible areas. In the event that the
inspector recommends that the Client consult with a pest control
contractor or other specialized expert(s), the Client must do so at
their own expense, assume all risks associated with a failure to
contact said pest control contractor or other specialized
expert(s), and the inspector and MKC shall not be responsible for
the work or recommendations of said pest control contractor or
other specialized expert(s). This Property Inspection Report is not
intended to be an inducement to encourage or discourage the
purchase or sale of the property and the conclusions and
recommendations of the inspector are only those contained in the
Property Inspection Report, not any oral remarks that may be made
by the inspector during the Property Inspection.</p>
<p>3. Exclusions. Please carefully read the exclusions set forth in
the Standards, because the Standards contain important information
regarding exclusions from the Property Inspection and Property
Inspection Report.</p>
<p>4. Warranties. There is no express or implied warranty of any
kind regarding the condition of the property or any of the items or
systems contained therein, or as to the future performance or
expected lifespan of any of the items or systems contained therein,
whether or not mentioned in the Property Inspection Report. This is
a limited inspection only, and this Agreement, the Property
Inspection and the Property Inspection Report do not constitute a
general warranty, an insurance policy, a certification or a
guarantee of any kind. Should the Client discover unfavorable
conditions that the Client suspects had been overlooked or not
reported on at the time of the Property Inspection, the Client
agrees to notify MKC within thirty (30) days of said discovery and
allow MKC access to the property to inspect said conditions.</p>
<p>5. Confidentiality. This Property Inspection is being performed,
and the Property Inspection Report is being prepared, for the
Client's sole, confidential and exclusive benefit and use, and may
not be transferred or assigned to any third party. If the Client
directly or indirectly allows or causes the Property Inspection
Report or any portion thereof to be disclosed or distributed to any
third party, the Client agrees to indemnify and hold the inspector
and MKC harmless from any and all losses, liabilities and related
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising
out of claims or actions based on the Property Inspection and/or
the Property Inspection Report brought by a third party or third
parties.</p>
<p>6. Arbitration. Any dispute concerning this Agreement or arising
from the Property Inspection or the Property Inspection Report
(unless based on the non-payment of fees) shall be resolved by
binding, non-appealable arbitration conducted in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties shall mutually agree upon one
(1) arbitrator who shall have at least ten (10) years experience in
the home inspection industry. The fees and expenses of arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be borne
by the party deemed responsible by the arbitrator except that, the
party filing for arbitration shall be responsible for all filing
fees. At the arbitration, the arbitrator may consider all claims
that would have been available to the parties in a court of law,
including, but not limited to, claims for lawful attorneys' fees
and multiple damages, where provided by statute. The Client hereby
acknowledges that participation in binding arbitration as provided
for herein is not intended to limit in any way the costs and
damages otherwise legally available to the Client.</p>
<p>7. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
among the parties and supersedes and nullifies all prior agreements
and understandings, express or implied, between the parties hereto
concerning the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be
modified or amended at any time and from time to time, but only by
a written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>8. Client's Responsibility. Pursuant to Section 6.03(4) of the
Standards, answers to the questions set forth on the Property
Questionnaire attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof should
be ascertained by you, the Client, from the Seller and/or the
Seller&rsquo;s Representative because they are important and
relevant to the purchase of the inspected dwelling and may not be
Readily Observable through inspection. There is no legal
obligation, duty, or requirement on behalf of the Seller and/or the
Seller&rsquo;s Representative to answer the questions set forth on
the Property Questionnaire. The Property Questionnaire will also be
attached to the Property Inspection Report</p>
<p>By signing below, I agree that I have read, understand and agree
to all the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement.</p>
