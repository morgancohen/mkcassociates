		<comText>FI, Branch circuit wiring in older homes: Homes built before 1930 may have older branch circuit wiring of the type referred to as &amp;quot;knob and tube&amp;quot; wiring. None was observed in accessible areas of this home. If you have knob and tube wiring in concealed areas, you may discover it when making alterations to the property. Knob and tube wiring can be unsafe if mishandled, damaged, or if it has other materials (such as insulation) in contact with it, and does not have an equipment ground. It may also restrict your ability to insulate in such areas, and circuit wiring should be upgraded in these areas. Other older wiring may also be present, and replacement of older wiring may be necessary if wiring is found to be too brittle, deteriorated, or cannot be used when updating or repairing a circuit. You should be prepared to replace wiring in these areas in the event that such wiring is found. Further investigation is suggested. [Electrician]</comText>

EPA recommends that asbestos containing materials that are in good condition and undisturbed be left undisturbed. If the coating does get disturbed, it could release asbestos fibers into the air. Because this type of ceiling coating can crumble as it ages or becomes damp, it should be tested and removed or properly covered to prevent any adverse exposure to the material if it does contain asbestos. Testing of these textured ceilings is recommended, contact an asbestos testing specialist for further investigation and mitigation as necessary following applicable regulations.

		<comName>CIRC pump no timer or thermo</comName>
		<comText>Energy Efficiency Upgrade: There is a circulator pump in the water heating system (located next to the water heater storage tank). This is designed to circulate hot water to the upper, remote areas of the home to prevent the homeowner having to wait until the hot water reaches these areas when running hot water in the home. This pump operates constantly if switched on. Generally, when these systems are installed, it is best practice to install a thermostat control (i.e. to shut off pump when the hot water makes it all the way through the system back to the water heater) and/or a timer control (i.e. instead of having the circulator pump operating 24 hours/day when it could be in use only during periods when people are awake in the home and need hot water). Upgrade is recommended. [Plumber]</comText>

		<comName>LEAD  line, replace</comName>
		<comText>RR: The main water supply line into the building from the street is a lead supply pipe.&amp;#160;This indicates that it is aged, may have deteriorated areas in places not visible from the interior of the basement, and could restrict water flow due to interior corrosion.&amp;#160;Lead pipes also have the potential of a health risk. Boston Water and Sewer Commission and MWRA (Massachusetts Water Resources Authority) both recommend replacement of lead water supply piping to reduce potential exposure to lead in the drinking water. It is recommended that the lead water main be replaced with a new main. [Excavation Contractor] &lt;p&gt;Also see MWRA website for information regarding lead in water supply. At a minimum, use of a water filtration system (that filters lead) for drinking water in the home water supply is recommended, and run the water 20-30 seconds before using (run water until the water runs fresh and cold), as per MWRA recommendations. MWRA link for lead in tap water: &lt;a href="http://www.mwra.com/04water/html/qual6leadinfo.htm"&gt;http://www.mwra.com/04water/html/qual6leadinfo.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boston Water and Sewer Commission has information posted on their website about lead in water. There is also a lead pipe replacement initiative that can in some cases provide assistance to people replacing their lead supply piping. See this link for further information: &lt;a href="http://www.bwsc.org/COMMUNITY/lead/lead.asp"&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/COMMUNITY/lead/lead.asp&lt;/a&gt; Also check with your local municipality regarding potential for any other assistance in lead piping replacement.</comText>

If you intend to remove it, have it tested by an asbestos specialist prior to disturbing the material. Keep in mind that there may be additional tile present in other areas or concealed areas in the home. Further investigation is recommended to determine if this flooring contains asbestos and to locate any additional asbestos containing materials or tile present in the home.

		<comName>RAD cond. not met SF</comName>
		<comText>FI: Conditions were not favorable for an accurate radon test. In order to perform a proper radon test following EPA protocol, all windows and doors in the entire home must be closed 12 hours before and remain closed during the entire test period. Often times it is very difficult to perform an accurate test if people are living in the home or building and do not have air conditioning. This can cause people to open windows, invalidating test results. It is recommended that you contract a radon measurement professional to provide radon testing to the property when proper test conditions can be met, and mitigation be installed as necessary. EPA recommends all homes be tested when living on the third floor or below.</comText>

This may help to minimize unexpected assessments and allow the association to engage in effective preventative maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, condominium associations should maintain a pest control plan for regular inspections of the property and treatment as necessary. Verify with the association that a pest control plan is in place.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>In a Massachusetts residential real estate transaction, Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detector installation is the responsibility of the seller. Inspection and testing of these units is made by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department. Coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller and/or the seller's agent. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in all residential structures with enclosed parking and/or heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&amp;#160; and outside bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm&lt;/a&gt; It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications.

		<comText>RR: There is no dryer vent piping installed in the laundry area in the unit for use with a dryer. This means that a dryer cannot vent to the exterior. Installation of dryer vent piping directly to the exterior or use of a condensing dryer (also referred to as a &amp;quot;ventless dryer&amp;quot;) is recommended. [Plumber]</comText>

		<comText>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READING THIS REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please read through this entire report and contact us with any questions at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All comments, observations, and recommendations in this report should be considered before purchasing this home. Recommendations to repair or replace or for further investigation suggest a second opinion and/or further inspection by a qualified contractor or specialist.&amp;#160;Costs associated with further inspection and repair or replacement should be considered &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;prior to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; signing a purchase and sale agreement for the property (and before the expiration of the inspection contingency period). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please read this report carefully including embedded internet links and/or attachments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographs in this report are representative of condition(s) that may also be found in other areas in the property.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;Not all comments will have a photograph of the defect or problem. The presence or absence of a photograph has no bearing on the significance of the condition observed. See comments for complete descriptions of defects or problems. Designations in the report (right, left, front, back, etc.) are to be interpreted as from the front of the property, facing the building, unless otherwise stated in the comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS IN THIS REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspected:&lt;/strong&gt; The inspector visually observed the item, component or unit. It is performing its primary function and may have normal wear and tear for its age and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Item:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160; Action is recommended, and exact nature of issue is described in the comment that follows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(RR) Repair or Replace: &lt;/strong&gt;The component or system is not functioning as intended and requires repair. Components or systems that can be repaired to satisfactory condition may not need replacement. It is recommended that you have this component and scope of the repair evaluated and repaired by the appropriate qualified specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(LI) Limited Inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspection of this component is limited or not possible. Inspection may be limited due to lack of visibility or access, weather, or other conditions. These conditions can sometimes conceal a defect in a component. Conditions causing these limitations should be corrected now and inspection or testing be made possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FI) Further Investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Further investigation of this component should be made now by the appropriate specialist, with the entire scope of necessary repairs determined, and repairs made as needed. This may also be indicated because the testing of this item is beyond the scope of the home inspection, or that there may be additional damage or related defect(s) that are concealed. Items marked with this comment may also require repair or replacement if found to be defective or if other problems are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FR) Future Repair:&lt;/strong&gt; This item is currently functioning, but may fail or require significant repair or replacement in the very near to medium term. You should anticipate that this item will need repair or replacement at any time. It is not possible to predict any components' lifespan or remaining service life. Components or systems can fail, and sometimes without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MR) Maintenance or Minor Repair:&lt;/strong&gt; This item requires minor or cosmetic repair. A maintenance or minor repair item can become a serious problem or can lead to other deficiencies if not repaired or corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NP) Not Present:&lt;/strong&gt; This component is not present on the property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When repairs or further investigation are recommended, the suggested contractor or professional is indicated in [brackets].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THIS INSPECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inspection was performed in accordance with and under the terms of our &lt;a href="http://www.mkchomeinspection.com/agreement.html"&gt;Property Inspection agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The inspection was also conducted in accordance with the Massachusetts &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dpl/boards/hi/cmr/26606.htm"&gt;Standards of Practice&lt;/a&gt; for Home Inspectors (MA regulations 266 CMR), and &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ocaterminal&amp;amp;L=6&amp;amp;L0=Home&amp;amp;L1=Licensee&amp;amp;L2=Division+of+Professional+Licensure+Boards&amp;amp;L3=Board+of+Registration+of+Home+Inspectors&amp;amp;L4=Statutes+and+Regulations&amp;amp;L5=Rules+and+Regulations+Governing+Home+Inspectors&amp;amp;sid=Eoca&amp;amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;amp;f=dpl_boards_hi_cmr_266cmr200&amp;amp;csid=Eoca"&gt;definitions&lt;/a&gt; of terms used in this report are included in these regulations. You should also be aware that there are &lt;a href="http://www.mkchomeinspection.com/documents/propquestion.pdf"&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; you may ask of the seller regarding this property. These four documents are also attached to this report.&amp;#160; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please keep in mind that this is not an architectural or engineering study of the structure, and it is not a code inspection. We do not inspect for, quote, or enforce building codes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inspecting components such as cabinets, doors, windows, or testing receptacles and other components where there are multiple similar components, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a representative number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these items is tested and/or inspected. Conditions observed for these components may be present on multiple other components in the home. All permanently installed appliances are tested except: microwaves, trash compactors and laundry machines. It is recommended that you refer to the &lt;a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/"&gt;Consumer Products Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; for information about product recalls and general safety of appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a comprehensive analysis of the property, please keep in mind that no house is perfect. All properties have conditions that require repair and correction, as well as ongoing maintenance. Also please keep in mind that there is a possibility of hidden or concealed damage in areas of the home that we will not be able to see because this inspection is limited to accessible areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note about mold and indoor air quality: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not inspect for or test mold or indoor air quality. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will indicate if we observe staining that appears to be mold. We also recommend that you have any suspect material tested for type and toxicity by a qualified indoor air quality specialist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have any concerns about mold or allergies to mold, it is recommended that you consult with an indoor air quality specialist to test for mold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; If there are areas where there is water and/or moisture infiltration into the building, this is considered a conducive condition for mold growth, and there may be mold present in areas not accessible or visible. Further investigation into concealed areas is recommended in these cases, and any suspect material found should be tested and mitigated as necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also see the attached Home Maintenance, Safety and Efficiency Upgrade sheet. This is intended as a guide to assist you in maintaining your home on a regular basis, adding additional safety features that may not already be present in your home, and upgrading your home to operate more efficiently, resulting in lower utility costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Massachusetts residential real estate transaction, Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detectors must be present in the home at the time of transfer of ownership. Installation of detectors in required locations if missing, and verification of all detectors in the home is the responsibility of the seller of the property. Inspection and testing of these units must be completed by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department, and coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in residential structures with enclosed parking or combustion heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&amp;#160;and in common areas as well as bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm&lt;/a&gt; It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications. UL information can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.ul.com/consumers/smoke.html"&gt;http://www.ul.com/consumers/smoke.html&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ul.com/consumers/co.html"&gt;http://www.ul.com/consumers/co.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not verify property lines, setbacks, rights of way, deeded accesses, property usage types, property development restrictions, flood zone areas, wetlands, or any other zoning or land use ordinances. It is recommended that you obtain a survey of the property as well as a municipal plot plan. Historical information about the property may also be useful. Check with the local municipal building department to review the file on this property for any permits that have been pulled for work on the property. If work has been completed on this property that requires a permit that was never obtained, or that has a permit that has not been signed off on, then it may result in added costs and responsibility to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make repairs or improvements to this property, use proper personal protection, safe practices, and obtain all necessary permitting for such work. All repairs that you make or contract for this property should comply with applicable requirements of the governing codes and sound construction practices.</comText>

This is likely due to the cold temperatures on the exterior. Heat pump systems are not efficient and do not perform well when temperatures fall below 30 degrees F. When the temperature is below 30 degrees F, the system should be operated in &amp;quot;Emergency&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Auxiliary&amp;quot; mode.

		<comText>RR, FI: The chimney flue that vents the boiler is blocked by debris in and above the cleanout opening. The flue was not visible from below due to this debris. There is potential for the debris to build up above the metal chimney vent connection. This would clog the flue and cause combustion products to leak into the basement or utility area.&amp;#160;It is recommended that the flue cleanout be cleaned and the flue further inspected.&lt;p&gt;Because there was no access into the chimney, it was not possible to determine if the chimney is lined or not. Appliances such as boilers, water heaters, and furnaces which vent into chimneys without liners can cause significant decay in the mortar and masonry.&amp;#160;This occurs because the moisture contained in exhaust products condenses in the flue and deteriorates the masonry.

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Did you tug on the hose bib(s) and test them for operation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Did you write in the report that you did not remove garden hose to check for a drip?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the spray nozzle leak or drip above or below the&amp;nbsp;sink when faucet is turned on? Is the aerator working?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Does the plumbing system&amp;nbsp;pass the&amp;nbsp;functional flow test? (Run a&amp;nbsp;shower at bathing temperature and then turn on the&amp;nbsp;sink faucets&amp;nbsp;and flush the&amp;nbsp;toilet. If you can still take a shower, it passes).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Toilets)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Does the toilet tank lid fit properly?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Does the tank have condensation leaking onto the&amp;nbsp;floor?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Is the&amp;nbsp;toilet loose at the&amp;nbsp;floor connection? Are there leak signs?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Was the&amp;nbsp;vinyl floor cut around the&amp;nbsp;toilet?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the&amp;nbsp;inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Are any bathtubs missing a shower?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the&amp;nbsp;jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your&amp;nbsp;inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the&amp;nbsp;home. Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old home with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look at the&amp;nbsp;perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). 
&lt;LI&gt;Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tears or blemishes etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing, 
&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged, 
&lt;LI&gt;rafters are&amp;nbsp;spaced too far apart, 
&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or 
&lt;LI&gt;you have a&amp;nbsp;weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. 
&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

Ambient air test is when you stick two meat thermometers into the main plenum of the air handler. One in the return air and one in the supply. Preferably near each other at the main trunk. If the AC has been running for an adequate amount of time before test you should see a range somewhere between 14 and 22 degrees. The supply should be the colder of the two. This test is not conclusive because of varying conditions but if it's out of range and the AC has had time to cool the home, then you can recommend an HVAC person (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Almost everyone expects an&amp;nbsp;electric 220-volt connection for the&amp;nbsp;Dryer. 
&lt;LI&gt;Make a note if the only connection for dryer is gas. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note if both are available, as a plus. 
&lt;LI&gt;Try to inspect the vent pipe for exhaust fans in the&amp;nbsp;attic to see if they terminate outside.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment).

Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>( OIL FURNACES ) over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Meanwhile, check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). An irratic movement of damper lid and soot build-up should be noted. Furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition of furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. If it's not running normal, recommend a licensed heat contractor service and repair as needed. Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. ( GAS FURNACES ) use a gas tracer around unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. If flame dances sharply or rolls under burner recommend service. Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition when furnace comes&amp;quot;on.&amp;quot; Use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). If over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. When in doubt, recommend a licensed heat contractor to inspect further. ( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well should still be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. ( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 60 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. The fan outside should be moving. And grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. The coils inside air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. ( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. There should never be an outlet on wall directly above electric base. Remove front cover on baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.</iiHelp>

		<iiText>BRANCH CIRCUITS-CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES (Report as in need of repair the lack of ground fault circuit protection where required.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not"Trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can "Trip" a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity," it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is "Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "Trips," doesn't mean it "Killed the circuit."&amp;nbsp;It could be defective.&amp;nbsp; New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested.&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights.&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing.&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#339966&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above.

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. On newer homes, note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tears or blemishes etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

		<iiText>WATER HEATER EQUIPMENT</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing. Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of home) or possible leak at liner. Rust along bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heat elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU. See Discoveries and Auto Comments. Gas water heaters should be cranked up to come on and test draw at diverter with a match. If draw does not suck out flame on match, there could be a venting problem. White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in gas when not venting properly. A greasy residue on top of gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.</iiHelp>

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old home with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains 
&lt;LI&gt;On newer homes, note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important on all homes, but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look at the&amp;nbsp;perimeter of the&amp;nbsp;floor for water stains or deterioration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Where outside faucets are located .&lt;BR&gt;2. Where drain lines are installed&amp;nbsp;from baths and kitchen&lt;BR&gt;3. Where insulation is missing or where newer insulation is installed.&lt;BR&gt;4. Where exterior doors or patio doors are.&lt;BR&gt;5. Where decks attach to outer band of floor system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other areas to look for are the&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;main girder&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; (termite damage is found often here). Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above. Often there are wood crumbs or small debris that was not cleaned up completely.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Understand that some walls have oil based paint on them and&lt;EM&gt;all buyers&lt;/EM&gt; are planning to use latex which means their paint job will fail. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil can go over oil based or latex. Latex cannot go over oil based paint.

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

If the AC has been running for an adequate amount of time before test you should see a range somewhere between 14 and 22 degrees. The supply should be the colder of the two. This test is not conclusive because of varying conditions but if it's out of range and the AC has had time to cool the home, then you can recommend an HVAC person (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps. The home inspector shall describe: Water supply and distribution piping materials; Drain, waste, and vent piping materials; Water heating equipment; and Location of main water supply shutoff device. The home inspector shall operate all plumbing fixtures, including their faucets and all exterior faucets attached to the house, except where the flow end of the faucet is connected to an appliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; State the effectiveness of anti-siphon devices; Determine whether water supply and waste disposal systems are public or private; Operate automatic safety controls; Operate any valve except water closet flush valves, fixture faucets, and hose faucets; Observe: Water conditioning systems; Fire and lawn sprinkler systems; On-site water supply quantity and quality; On-site waste disposal systems; Foundation irrigation systems; Spas, except as to functional flow and functional drainage; Swimming pools; Solar water heating equipment; or Observe the system for proper sizing, design, or use of proper materials.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Floor spaces:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A vapor barrier is a roll of plastic (6 mil thick preferred) that is spread out over the&amp;nbsp;crawlspace to keep moisture from entering the&amp;nbsp;crawlspace&amp;nbsp;from the ground. It is essential and inexpensive compared to its prevention abilities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to report on:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Concealed insulation and vapor retarders; or Venting equipment that is integral with household appliances.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>Central Air should not be ran if outside temperature is at 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Turn on A/C and wait about 15 minutes or so. Grab and hold the suction line just before it enters air handler inside and feel for ice cold. (This will tell you if the compressor outside is making cold air). No cold feeling could mean  a number of things that will involve servicing the unit (low on refrigerant, leak, compressor problem etc.) Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. Recommend service. If the suction line is iced over where it enters Air Handler, the coils inside air handler may need cleaning. To check for ambient air, you would need the A/C to run longer than 15 minutes or so. Insert a thermometer in the supply plenum, and then insert another thermometer into the return-air plenum. The Return air should be within 20-25 degrees of the thermometer in the supply plenum. The amount of time the A/C would need to run before checking ambient air will vary, depending upon how hot it is inside when you first ran the A/C. This may require an hour or so to give the A/C a chance to work at it's potential.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Understand that some walls have oil based paint on them and&lt;EM&gt;all buyers&lt;/EM&gt; are planning to use latex which means their paint job will fail. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil can go over oil based or latex. Latex cannot go over oil based paint. 
&lt;LI&gt;There is a product that is a sealer/primer that would need to go over oil based paint and then latex can be applied.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

&lt;P&gt;Circle the house slowly, paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along the top of garage door and window brick mold.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green algae areas&lt;BR&gt;should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended. 
&lt;LI&gt;Problem areas to look for are where roof stops at chimney wall (roof junction) or where the&amp;nbsp;end of the&amp;nbsp;gutter butts against another wall of the home. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for siding in contact with ground. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look under windows, at dormers and above deck at starter row.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the&amp;nbsp;inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the&amp;nbsp;jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your&amp;nbsp;inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the&amp;nbsp;home. Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Then call&amp;nbsp;the electrician&amp;nbsp;and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn. Pass all panels that appear to be wired properly based on what is proper, and recommend an electrician on everything else.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Are there any electric outlets located on the&amp;nbsp;wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard, which is a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). 
&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit. 
&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong &lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. 
&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). 
&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Ambient air test is when you stick two meat thermometers into the main plenum of the air handler. One in the return air and one in the supply. Preferably near each other at the main trunk. If the AC has been running for an adequate amount of time before test you should see a range somewhere between 14 and 22 degrees. The supply should be the colder of the two. This test is not conclusive because of varying conditions but if it's out of range and the AC has had time to cool the home, then you can recommend an HVAC person (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>DISHWASHER</iiText>
		<iiHelp>The first thing you should do when you begin an inspection is start dishwasher to allow time to complete cycle before you through. Examine the dishwasher, drain line and run dishwasher through a cycle. If they're dirty dishes inside, add detergent (usually stored under the sink). Just make sure its detergent for dishwasher and not dishwashing detergent, or you'll be there for a while. Check all the movable parts and the heating element and support clips. Make sure the unit is securely mounted to countertop. Remember a leaky gasket could result in a new dishwasher, so always run through a cycle to check for leaks.</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check the&amp;nbsp;countertop at sink rim for absorption or damage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Check the backside of drawers at the&amp;nbsp;cabinet base for mold.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Check the&amp;nbsp;wall behind the&amp;nbsp;refrigerator for mold.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Check the&amp;nbsp;Icemaker line behind the&amp;nbsp;refrigerator for kinks or damage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Are there any extra large cut-outs for plumbing or the&amp;nbsp;range vent that may allow air infiltration from the attic or crawlspace?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. What is the microwave clearance from the&amp;nbsp;range? Most require 18 inches&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Is the sink base deteriorated or sagging from previous leaks at the&amp;nbsp;bottom shelf?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Does the&amp;nbsp;back splash on the&amp;nbsp;counter behind the&amp;nbsp;sink prevent splash water from possibly going behind sink base and causing mold on concealed wall?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Is the&amp;nbsp;kick board missing anywhere in the&amp;nbsp;kitchen cabinetry that may allow trash to collect or rodents to enter?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11. Is the shelving warped?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;12. Make sure the&amp;nbsp;island cabinet cannot be moved if a wired outlet is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Including signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>First, turn on the broiler in oven while touching element, turn off and check the bake element. Then check the support clips that hold the broiler and bake elements in place to make sure they're not missing or loose. Check the oven door for warp and inspect gasket seal. Check for burn marks at the oven doorframe for heat loss from failed gasket or door alignment or springs. Open close storage drawer for proper operation. Turn on all the burners to high, finger touch and turn back off. This method works and you don't have the risk of someone in home getting burned while elements are cooling down from high setting. On Gas stoves check all burners for even flame at all settings. Recommend cleaning if a burner delays ignition or if flames pop or if uneven.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

		<iiText>DOORS (Interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. Check for holes in the&amp;nbsp;door and for a doorstop. Note any trim missing, or hardware (check all doors). BASEMENT/CRAWLSPACE:&amp;nbsp;Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water at all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter crawl space, look at each inside wall, left and right of entry, for water or mud marks on wall. If the&amp;nbsp;basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and that it appears to work properly. Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating on the&amp;nbsp;bottom or deteriorated. SLIDING GLASS DOORS AND PATIO DOORS:&amp;nbsp; Open and close the&amp;nbsp;door as needed and check for "Day light" and continuous weather-stripping. Also close the&amp;nbsp;door with the&amp;nbsp;knob until it latches. Then turn the&amp;nbsp;deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. GARAGE DOORS: Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the&amp;nbsp;door opening. Document if the door reverses or not. If you use your hand to resist, and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if not careful. The door can "fold-up", damaging the&amp;nbsp;door panel and chain drive. Even if the door has electronic sensors it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of the&amp;nbsp;opener.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Do you notice any GFCI outlets with freezers plugged into them?&amp;nbsp;Don't forget to reset GFCI. Two prong plugs in the&amp;nbsp;Garage or around any areas with water?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button.&amp;nbsp;It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the&amp;nbsp;panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that&amp;nbsp;pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.&amp;nbsp; With&amp;nbsp;gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed.&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer.&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even.&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service.&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any).&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level.&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass.&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule.&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working.&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat.&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat.&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service.&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant.&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly.&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees.&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor.&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base.&lt;LI&gt;Remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube.

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Are the foam sleeves on the&amp;nbsp;suction line intact?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Are bushes or a&amp;nbsp;fence obstructing air flow?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Hydronic systems should have a water heater that is designed for heating the&amp;nbsp;home and not use converted water heaters. Converted water heaters may not have a high enough BTU rating.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Are there any electric outlets located on the wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard which could be a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Heating Equipment&amp;nbsp;over 15 years old and still&amp;nbsp;operating should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing them&amp;nbsp;annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;(Oil furnaces) Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;An erratic movement of the&amp;nbsp;damper lid on the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe and/or soot build-up should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;The furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. 
&lt;LI&gt;It's a good technique to observe the firing, or ignition, of the&amp;nbsp;furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed. 
&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. 
&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. 
&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service. 
&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. 
&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. 
&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. 
&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be&amp;nbsp;operated in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. 
&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. 
&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. 
&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees. 
&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. 
&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base. 
&lt;LI&gt;On older electric baseboards, you may want to remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Look for where gutters are draining to and if there is standing water in the&amp;nbsp;vicinity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are there gutter screens installed? Are there leak signs at the&amp;nbsp;gutter seams?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

This is because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening.

Sometimes the adjustment screws/knobs will not adjust it properly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7.

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Hydronic systems should have a water heater that is designed for heating the&amp;nbsp;home and not use converted water heaters. Converted water heaters may not have a high enough BTU rating.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Are there any electric outlets located on the wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard which could be a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Heating Equipment&amp;nbsp;over 15 years old and still&amp;nbsp;operating should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing them&amp;nbsp;annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;(Oil furnaces) Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;An erratic movement of the&amp;nbsp;damper lid on the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe and/or soot build-up should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;The furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. 
&lt;LI&gt;It's a good technique to observe the firing, or ignition, of the&amp;nbsp;furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed. 
&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. 
&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. 
&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service. 
&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. 
&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. 
&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. 
&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be&amp;nbsp;operated in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. 
&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. 
&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. 
&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees. 
&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. 
&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base. 
&lt;LI&gt;On older electric baseboards, you may want to remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Note the absence (or condition)&amp;nbsp;of firewall separation in attic when building is multi-family.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11. Are plywood clips missing between sheets of plywood (if sags are apparent)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;12. Is there any loose wiring or exposed splices at the whole house fan?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;13. Note any catch pans or containers in the attic that may indicate periodic leaks&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Note if rafters are 2 x 4 but not truss construction. Usually found in some older homes and can allow sagging of roof.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing, 
&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged, 
&lt;LI&gt;rafters are&amp;nbsp;spaced too far apart, 
&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or 
&lt;LI&gt;you have a&amp;nbsp;weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. 
&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Home Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof. The home inspector shall describe the type of Foundation, floor structure, wall structure, columns or piers, ceiling structure, roof structure.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Enter any area or perform any procedure that may damage the property or its components or be dangerous to or adversely effect the health of the home inspector or other persons.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant.

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

		<iiText>WALLS (interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Walls can tell you a lot about the house. Settlement cracks should be noted as minor or significant in relation to the structure or to the wall covering, as whether or not a repair is needed. Note if it is "Cosmetic" after you mention the crack, if you think it's ok. On an old house, push on the wall near a window to see if it gives, if you suspect deterioration or termite damage. Bowed paneling on a wall alerts you to moisture or possible water intrusion. Faint water signs can sometimes be found under windows and along the&amp;nbsp;baseboard. Black flash marks on or&amp;nbsp;around an outlet on the&amp;nbsp;wall should be noted. Recommend a licensed electrician inspect further. EXTERIOR: Circle the house slowly paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along top of garage door and window brick mold. Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green alga areas. Ground clearance of&amp;nbsp;six inches or better where possible is&amp;nbsp;recommended.</iiHelp>

Where outside faucets are located .&lt;BR&gt;2. Where drain lines are installed&amp;nbsp;from baths and kitchen&lt;BR&gt;3. Where insulation is missing or where newer insulation is installed.&lt;BR&gt;4. Where exterior doors or patio doors are.&lt;BR&gt;5.

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above. Often there are wood crumbs or small debris that was not cleaned up completely.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Including signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Enter any area or perform any procedure that may damage the property or its components or be dangerous to or adversely effect the health of the home inspector or other persons.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing, 
&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged, 
&lt;LI&gt;rafters are&amp;nbsp;spaced too far apart, 
&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or 
&lt;LI&gt;you have a&amp;nbsp;weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. 
&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

Did you write in the report that you did not remove garden hose to check for a drip?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.

Does the plumbing system&amp;nbsp;pass the&amp;nbsp;functional flow test?

If you can still take a shower, it passes).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Toilets)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.

Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the&amp;nbsp;inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Wet joints?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the&amp;nbsp;jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your&amp;nbsp;inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the&amp;nbsp;home. Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Heating Equipment&amp;nbsp;over 15 years old and still&amp;nbsp;operating should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing them&amp;nbsp;annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;(Oil furnaces) Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;An erratic movement of the&amp;nbsp;damper lid on the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe and/or soot build-up should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;The furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. 
&lt;LI&gt;It's a good technique to observe the firing, or ignition, of the&amp;nbsp;furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed. 
&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. 
&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. 
&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service. 
&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. 
&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. 
&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. 
&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be&amp;nbsp;operated in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. 
&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. 
&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. 
&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees. 
&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. 
&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base. 
&lt;LI&gt;On older electric baseboards, you may want to remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the&amp;nbsp;inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

Use a lighter at the&amp;nbsp;draft hood when the&amp;nbsp;gas water heater is on to check for proper draw.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; A gas water heater in the closet needs fresh air from the&amp;nbsp;attic at the&amp;nbsp;ceiling and near the&amp;nbsp;floor.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing.&lt;LI&gt;Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of home) or possible leak at the liner.&lt;LI&gt;Rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heating elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that&amp;nbsp;pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.&amp;nbsp; With&amp;nbsp;gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Are there bushes against the siding?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is the siding in contact with the ground or mulch?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Check the siding at planter boxes, stacked wood and downspout locations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Is siding deteriorated where the&amp;nbsp;the deck attaches to home (above deck)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Are there any lifted nails, discolored&amp;nbsp;or loose&amp;nbsp;siding?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Are there any repairs to siding or soffits that&amp;nbsp;are inconsistent?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on soffits, fascia, column bases, window sills, porch flooring or bottom of door jambs?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Do you see where the dryer vent terminates outside?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Circle the house slowly, paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along the top of garage door and window brick mold.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green algae areas&lt;BR&gt;should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended. 
&lt;LI&gt;Problem areas to look for are where roof stops at chimney wall (roof junction) or where the&amp;nbsp;end of the&amp;nbsp;gutter butts against another wall of the home. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for siding in contact with ground. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look under windows, at dormers and above deck at starter row.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Note any old downspout drain tile/ piping that may no longer work properly or downspouts that need drainlines or splashblocks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Look for where gutters are draining to and if there is standing water in the&amp;nbsp;vicinity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are there gutter screens installed? Are there leak signs at the&amp;nbsp;gutter seams?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Note any stains around chimney&amp;nbsp;or vent pipes in attic.&amp;nbsp; Is there mold&amp;nbsp;or moisture present?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there any knob and tube wiring in the attic?&amp;nbsp;They should not be covered with insulation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Is there a whole house fan or a&amp;nbsp;thermostatically controlled fan in attic?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Is there an air handler in attic? Filter? Drip pan? Float switch obstructed in drip pan?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Is insulation installed&amp;nbsp;right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Are pull-down stairs to the attic&amp;nbsp;mounted properly to ceiling joists at hinge points? Are nuts tight at each step?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Does attic access fit the opening or seal opening properly?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Note the absence (or condition)&amp;nbsp;of firewall separation in attic when building is multi-family.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11. Are plywood clips missing between sheets of plywood (if sags are apparent)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;12. Is there any loose wiring or exposed splices at the whole house fan?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;13. Note any catch pans or containers in the attic that may indicate periodic leaks&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Note if rafters are 2 x 4 but not truss construction. Usually found in some older homes and can allow sagging of roof.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing, 
&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged, 
&lt;LI&gt;rafters are&amp;nbsp;spaced too far apart, 
&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or 
&lt;LI&gt;you have a&amp;nbsp;weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. 
&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets,&amp;nbsp;not cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old home with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look at the&amp;nbsp;perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration.

		<iiText>SERVICE ENTRANCE AND PANELS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Circuit breaker brand should match the panel brand. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the home. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their own&amp;nbsp;circuit brand only, or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS. WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company. Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard. General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label. When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on panel states that no other brand is allowed. The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in form of litigation. Whether they do or don 't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it. There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself. Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground. Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers wouldn't do it.</iiHelp>

If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>INSULATION UNDER FLOOR SYSTEM</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to report on:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Concealed insulation and vapor retarders; or Venting equipment that is integral with household appliances.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that&amp;nbsp;pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.&amp;nbsp; With&amp;nbsp;gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

The home inspector shall operate all plumbing fixtures, including their faucets and all exterior faucets attached to the house, except where the flow end of the faucet is connected to an appliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; State the effectiveness of anti-siphon devices; Determine whether water supply and waste disposal systems are public or private; Operate automatic safety controls; Operate any valve except water closet flush valves, fixture faucets, and hose faucets; Observe: Water conditioning systems; Fire and lawn sprinkler systems; On-site water supply quantity and quality; On-site waste disposal systems; Foundation irrigation systems; Spas, except as to functional flow and functional drainage; Swimming pools; Solar water heating equipment; or Observe the system for proper sizing, design, or use of proper materials.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any possible asbestos on old boilers, radiator piping or vent pipe to chimney (older homes). Sometimes asbestos can be found on the&amp;nbsp;underside of decorative radiator covers inside home.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure you note if a room does not have a register or vent.
&lt;LI&gt;Also inspect all ductwork accessible.
&lt;LI&gt;Note if the ductwork is not insulated, if there is AC.
&lt;LI&gt;Many times the tape is failing and the ductpipe has pulled loose from the&amp;nbsp;register underneath the&amp;nbsp;floor.
&lt;LI&gt;Pull out or examine the filter as part of your air handler inspection. Many times the filter is the wrong size or clogged beyond belief. A clogged filter can cause $10 a month in electricity cost&amp;nbsp;and shorten the life of the unit, not to mention poor air quality.
&lt;LI&gt;New construction:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Make sure you try to look deep inside the&amp;nbsp;return air cavity&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;wall to look for unhealthy items left behind by sub contractors.
&lt;LI&gt;Radiators for old boilers can clog or not heat fully.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes they can be blown clean by a boiler technician and sometimes they cannot. One radiator could cost $1000 or more easily ($80 a rung so I've heard) so be sure and write up any that do not get hot on both ends as needing servicing or further inspection by a Boiler technician.
&lt;LI&gt;Read the auto-comments in the heat section.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a&amp;nbsp;fireplace that has had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the&amp;nbsp;roof on the&amp;nbsp;shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner&amp;nbsp;is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it&amp;nbsp;to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the&amp;nbsp;insert to its&amp;nbsp;liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the&amp;nbsp;insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the home. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting the insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Understand that some walls have oil based paint on them and&lt;EM&gt;all buyers&lt;/EM&gt; are planning to use latex which means their paint job will fail. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil can go over oil based or latex. Latex cannot go over oil based paint. 
&lt;LI&gt;There is a product that is a sealer/primer that would need to go over oil based paint and then latex can be applied.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Including signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Enter any area or perform any procedure that may damage the property or its components or be dangerous to or adversely effect the health of the home inspector or other persons.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>ATTIC INSULATION</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to report on:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Concealed insulation and vapor retarders; or Venting equipment that is integral with household appliances.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

The cap or counter flashing provides a hood over the&amp;nbsp;step flashing and is bent and inserted into a masonry cut groove in brick or block. Flashing a rock chimney after a roof tear off is near impossible to do properly because you can't cut a groove in rock to tuck in&amp;nbsp;bent flashing. The cap flashing is then laid flush and caulked at top, often failing in a short period of time.&lt;LI&gt;There is&amp;nbsp;a product called Peel-n-Seal that is a&amp;nbsp;foil backed sheet of tar and is pliable. It comes in a roll that can be cut with a knife and after peeling off wax paper can be molded to fit and seal against uneven surfaces like rock or stone. Some guys heat up the&amp;nbsp;tar backing first with a butane torch for immediate sealing, depending on outside temperatures. This doesn't look as good as copper, but is a lot better than not installing proper cap or counter flashing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Look for where gutters are draining to and if there is standing water in the&amp;nbsp;vicinity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are there gutter screens installed? Are there leak signs at the&amp;nbsp;gutter seams?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>INSULATION under FLOOR SYSTEM</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to report on:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Concealed insulation and vapor retarders; or Venting equipment that is integral with household appliances.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>INTERIOR DRAIN, WASTE AND VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Most everyone expects electric 220-volt connection for Dryer. Note if the only connection for dryer is gas. Note if both are available as a plus. Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. Many older homes still have 1&amp;quot;1/2 diameter wasteline and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may over run drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health dept or building safety on this issue. Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. The outlet for washing machine should be grounded if existing. A repair would be a GFCI outlet.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets,&amp;nbsp;not cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above.

		<iiText>INSULATION IN ATTIC</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Including signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control.

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

If the&amp;nbsp;water heater is&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;crawlspace or basement, it should not be lower than ground level.

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that&amp;nbsp;pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.&amp;nbsp; With&amp;nbsp;gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Then call&amp;nbsp;the electrician&amp;nbsp;and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn.

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Are the foam sleeves on the&amp;nbsp;suction line intact?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Are bushes or a&amp;nbsp;fence obstructing air flow?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Hydronic systems should have a water heater that is designed for heating the&amp;nbsp;home and not use converted water heaters. Converted water heaters may not have a high enough BTU rating.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Are there any electric outlets located on the wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard which could be a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Heating Equipment&amp;nbsp;over 15 years old and still&amp;nbsp;operating should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing them&amp;nbsp;annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;(Oil furnaces) Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;An erratic movement of the&amp;nbsp;damper lid on the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe and/or soot build-up should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;The furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. 
&lt;LI&gt;It's a good technique to observe the firing, or ignition, of the&amp;nbsp;furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed. 
&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. 
&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. 
&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service. 
&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). 
&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. 
&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. 
&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. 
&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be&amp;nbsp;operated in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. 
&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. 
&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. 
&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. 
&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees. 
&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. 
&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base. 
&lt;LI&gt;On older electric baseboards, you may want to remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Report signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or signs of abnormal or harmful condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Home Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof. The home inspector shall describe the type of Foundation, floor structure, wall structure, columns or piers, ceiling structure, roof structure. The home inspector shall: Probe structural components where deterioration is suspected; Enter under floor crawl spaces, basements, and attic spaces except when access is obstructed, when entry could damage the property, or when dangerous or adverse situations are suspected; Report the methods used to observe under floor crawl spaces and attics; and Report signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or signs of abnormal or harmful condensation on building components.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Enter any area or perform any procedure that may damage the property or its components or be dangerous to or adversely effect the health of the home inspector or other persons.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

Hidden inside a cabinet? Not accessible?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A bond wire is a ground wire that grounds the panel to the metal plumbing that goes into the soil. A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but&amp;nbsp;not new construction. The problem occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic or PVC, which&amp;nbsp;removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make sure the electric panel is grounded.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Some electricians say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a ground. I have heard some electricians disagree and say that there is always a way to ground the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that "there is only one ground wire found on the&amp;nbsp;panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed to non-metal and there is no ground". Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the&amp;nbsp;panel. I recommend an electrician add another ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the home. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS.&lt;LI&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company.&lt;LI&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard.&lt;LI&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label.&lt;LI&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later it was&amp;nbsp;found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the&amp;nbsp;panel states that no other brand is allowed.&lt;LI&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the&amp;nbsp;form of litigation. Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it.&lt;LI&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself.&lt;LI&gt;Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground.&lt;LI&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electricians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the&amp;nbsp;home to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Then call&amp;nbsp;the electrician&amp;nbsp;and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn.

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above. Often there are wood crumbs or small debris that was not cleaned up completely.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;Circle the house slowly, paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along the top of garage door and window brick mold.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green algae areas&lt;BR&gt;should be noted. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended. 
&lt;LI&gt;Problem areas to look for are where roof stops at chimney wall (roof junction) or where the&amp;nbsp;end of the&amp;nbsp;gutter butts against another wall of the home. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for siding in contact with ground. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look under windows, at dormers and above deck at starter row.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). 
&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit. 
&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong &lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. 
&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). 
&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Did you tug on the hose bib(s) and test them for operation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Did you write in the report that you did not remove garden hose to check for a drip?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the spray nozzle leak or drip above or below the&amp;nbsp;sink when faucet is turned on? Is the aerator working?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Does the plumbing system&amp;nbsp;pass the&amp;nbsp;functional flow test? (Run a&amp;nbsp;shower at bathing temperature and then turn on the&amp;nbsp;sink faucets&amp;nbsp;and flush the&amp;nbsp;toilet. If you can still take a shower, it passes).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Toilets)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Does the toilet tank lid fit properly?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Does the tank have condensation leaking onto the&amp;nbsp;floor?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Is the&amp;nbsp;toilet loose at the&amp;nbsp;floor connection? Are there leak signs?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Was the&amp;nbsp;vinyl floor cut around the&amp;nbsp;toilet?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the&amp;nbsp;inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the&amp;nbsp;toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Are any bathtubs missing a shower?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the&amp;nbsp;jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your&amp;nbsp;inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the&amp;nbsp;home. Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are walkable roofs and&amp;nbsp;not too&amp;nbsp;steep. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the&amp;nbsp;roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old home with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc.

But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the&amp;nbsp;panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

When the&amp;nbsp;gas furnace and gas water heater connect to one vent, the highest BTU&amp;nbsp;unit needs to connect on the bottom.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. In most areas, the liners for wood burning stoves or fireplaces cannot share the&amp;nbsp;liner with other fuel burning type units such as Gas.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Unless you can clearly see all of the&amp;nbsp;liner from end to end, use the&amp;nbsp;auto-comment that the chimney liner was not inspected&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6.

Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a&amp;nbsp;fireplace that has had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the&amp;nbsp;roof on the&amp;nbsp;shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner&amp;nbsp;is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it&amp;nbsp;to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the&amp;nbsp;insert to its&amp;nbsp;liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the&amp;nbsp;insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the home. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting the insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Note the absence (or condition)&amp;nbsp;of firewall separation in attic when building is multi-family.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11. Are plywood clips missing between sheets of plywood (if sags are apparent)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;12. Is there any loose wiring or exposed splices at the whole house fan?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;13. Note any catch pans or containers in the attic that may indicate periodic leaks&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Note if rafters are 2 x 4 but not truss construction. Usually found in some older homes and can allow sagging of roof.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing, 
&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged, 
&lt;LI&gt;rafters are&amp;nbsp;spaced too far apart, 
&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or 
&lt;LI&gt;you have a&amp;nbsp;weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. 
&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where&amp;nbsp;blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;missing. 
&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Including signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

This is because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

One radiator could cost $1000 or more easily ($80 a rung so I've heard) so be sure and write up any that do not get hot on both ends as needing servicing or further inspection by a Boiler technician.&lt;LI&gt;Read the auto-comments in the heat section.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Then call&amp;nbsp;the electrician&amp;nbsp;and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn.

		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights&amp;quot;Faint or Dim&amp;quot; and you press the button on the plug and it shows&amp;quot;Reverse polarity,&amp;quot; it may just be a&amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is&amp;quot;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it&amp;quot;Trips,&amp;quot; doesn't mean it&amp;quot;Killed the circuit.&amp;quot; It could be defective. New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

		<iiText>ROOF STRUCTURE AND ATTIC (If the attic is inaccessible, report the method used to inspect)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed something. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. Always note fire damage in the&amp;nbsp;attic.&amp;nbsp; And do a stab test to determine the strength of a charred area. Sometimes the"Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend repairs. Sags can occur where a plywood clip is missing, you have a damaged truss or rafters spaced a little too far apart&amp;nbsp;or you have a&amp;nbsp;bad crown in wood. Or possibly&amp;nbsp;a weak piece of plywood. Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4" rafter spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation and clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. To get the&amp;nbsp;R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply thickness in inches by 3.142857. For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. Or better yet, use the"AUTO COMMENTS." Insulation usually comes in four Types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand, Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock, Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals. Rigid Foam Board (used on the&amp;nbsp;exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) is obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>This question is good for miscellaneous plumbing items or components such as pressure reducing valves, broken plumbing, incorrect or problem in plumbing. Outside faucets. To inspect thoroughly, do the basement or crawlspace last. By testing the faucets and drains first (inside the house) will allow you to discover leaks underneath. Trace all plumbing lines and look at the floor or plastic on floor for water or stains etc. Now's a good time to check for a P trap on the washing machine drain line. Also the Dryer vent piping.</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the&amp;nbsp;thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:&amp;nbsp; Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the&amp;nbsp;attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The home inspector shall describe: Insulation in unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The home inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old home with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look at the&amp;nbsp;perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet).

Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The light fixture outlet in the&amp;nbsp;bath should be disabled if not grounded.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. There should be at least two outlets in each room.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Note any ceiling fans that wobble more than expected&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Are there any electric outlets located on the&amp;nbsp;wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard, which is a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). 
&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit. 
&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong &lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. 
&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). 
&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Almost everyone expects an&amp;nbsp;electric 220-volt connection for the&amp;nbsp;Dryer. 
&lt;LI&gt;Make a note if the only connection for dryer is gas. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note if both are available, as a plus.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above. Often there are wood crumbs or small debris that was not cleaned up completely.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Are there any electric outlets located on the&amp;nbsp;wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard, which is a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Document if the door reverses or not.&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive.&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Note any old downspout drain tile/ piping that may no longer work properly or downspouts that need drainlines or splashblocks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Look for where gutters are draining to and if there is standing water in the&amp;nbsp;vicinity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Are there gutter screens installed? Are there leak signs at the&amp;nbsp;gutter seams?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling.

		<iiHelp>Most everyone expects electric 220-volt connection for Dryer. Note if the only connection for dryer is gas. Note if both are available as a plus. Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. Many older homes still have 1&amp;quot;1/2 diameter wasteline and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may over run drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health dept or building safety on this issue. Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. The outlet for washing machine should be grounded if existing. A repair would be a GFCI outlet.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards home that may cause problems like erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. 
&lt;LI&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a&amp;nbsp;dirt bank and the&amp;nbsp;house (or above dirt bank) may help in diverting water. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. 
&lt;LI&gt;I have recommended in a report&amp;nbsp;that "gutters are loose and needs to be secured" only to get a call back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as&amp;nbsp;some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the&amp;nbsp;panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to home is to use&amp;nbsp;5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between.

Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

		<iiText>FOUNDATIONS, BASEMENTS and CRAWLSPACES (Report signs of abnormal or harmful water penetration into the building or signs of abnormal or harmful condensation on building components.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). 
&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit. 
&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong &lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. 
&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). 
&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.

&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

To do this, use the cut-off switch at the&amp;nbsp;furnace&amp;nbsp;before you set the&amp;nbsp;thermostat to turn&amp;nbsp;the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for&amp;nbsp;service and repair as needed.&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer.&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the&amp;nbsp;unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even.&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the&amp;nbsp;burner recommend service.&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the&amp;nbsp;chimney for integrity and proper seal.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the&amp;nbsp;vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any).&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level.&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass.&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule.&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working.&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving.&amp;nbsp;Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat.&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat.&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service.&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the&amp;nbsp;air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant.&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly.&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air&amp;nbsp;at the air handler. The difference in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees.&lt;LI&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor.&lt;LI&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base.&lt;LI&gt;Remove the front cover on the&amp;nbsp;baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the&amp;nbsp;base located inside a tube.

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;For new home construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and mounting of cabinets or securing the&amp;nbsp;countertop. 
&lt;LI&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client&amp;nbsp;on having&amp;nbsp;near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out for the&amp;nbsp;dishwasher and&amp;nbsp;cut-outs for the&amp;nbsp;plumbing lines the size of a baseball. 
&lt;LI&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired&amp;nbsp;outlet, should be noted as well. 
&lt;LI&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the&amp;nbsp;counter. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the&amp;nbsp;cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp). 
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the&amp;nbsp;rear burner or heating&amp;nbsp;element because of a fire hazard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Remember, in&amp;nbsp;new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet installation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

(Murphy's law).&lt;LI&gt;Plastic or vinyl windows on a new home can sometimes be extremely difficult to lock. This is because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening. Sometimes daylight can be seen (air infiltration) between the window and side jambs. This could involve a lot of work to correct.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that&amp;nbsp;pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.&amp;nbsp; With&amp;nbsp;gas, the added pressure is a result of steam.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a pressure test with finger on&amp;nbsp;exterior door trim /jambs at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Note if the main entry doors are hollow core which is not as secure as a solid core.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the&amp;nbsp;garage door works best but there is a&amp;nbsp;risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the&amp;nbsp;door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the&amp;nbsp;door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the&amp;nbsp;door is delaminating or deteriorated&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass&amp;nbsp;and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raise the&amp;nbsp;garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the&amp;nbsp;floor at the&amp;nbsp;middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the&amp;nbsp;door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Also where wooden supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic barrier for evidence of a repair above.

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

(Murphy's law).&lt;LI&gt;Plastic or vinyl windows on a new home can sometimes be extremely difficult to lock. This is because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening. Sometimes daylight can be seen (air infiltration) between the window and side jambs.

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Notice any new downspouts or&amp;nbsp;splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water intrusion once inside the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the&amp;nbsp;basement or crawlspace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they indicate current intrusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should&amp;nbsp;be noted in your report. Whether&amp;nbsp;or not you&amp;nbsp;use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the&amp;nbsp;bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More Info:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or&amp;nbsp;if they are&amp;nbsp;old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a&amp;nbsp;home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack.&amp;nbsp;To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? 
&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall?&amp;nbsp;No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has&amp;nbsp;moved because of the load behind it.&amp;nbsp; A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they&amp;nbsp;are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are&amp;nbsp;typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip&amp;nbsp;(worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway&amp;nbsp;for water or mud marks on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the&amp;nbsp;foundation wall as a water line or stain. 
&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump. 
&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. 
&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc.

&lt;LI&gt;Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet).

Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.&amp;nbsp;Instead of a small split in the&amp;nbsp;pipe like will happen with&amp;nbsp;copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the&amp;nbsp;exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

Even when it looks perfect.&lt;LI&gt;Homes that have&amp;nbsp;had a pressure washing company spray onto skylights can blow away, or push sealant caulking away, and cause leaks. You can't know what has happened since the skylight has been installed.&lt;LI&gt;Look for fresh paint inside at the&amp;nbsp;skylight chase or tell-tale water marks that may only be condensation and not leaks.&lt;LI&gt;Vaulted ceilings with skylights can cause condensation in summer, if the ceiling air gets hot enough and an AC vent is mixing with hot ceiling air. Water droplets (or stains) can form on the ceiling. Sometimes it is difficult to determine which one is occurring in the&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;LI&gt;Chimneys: Look for loose mortar above the&amp;nbsp;roof line.&lt;LI&gt;Check the cement crown for cracks.&lt;LI&gt;White efflorescence or flaking of brick (spalling) indicates moisture is soaking into the&amp;nbsp;brick somewhere.&lt;LI&gt;Do not try to remove metal hood bonnets on chimney to inspect liner.

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the&amp;nbsp;bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to&amp;nbsp;come on in order to test the&amp;nbsp;draw at the&amp;nbsp;diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably&amp;nbsp;suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the&amp;nbsp;gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the&amp;nbsp;housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection.

The window that you don't inspect is the one that is not working. (Murphy's law).&lt;LI&gt;The window that has all the cute glass knick-knacks on it is the one that doesn't work. (Murphy's law).&lt;LI&gt;Plastic or vinyl windows on a new home can sometimes be extremely difficult to lock. This is because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening. Sometimes daylight can be seen (air infiltration) between the window and side jambs. This could involve a lot of work to correct.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps. The home inspector shall describe: Water supply and distribution piping materials; Drain, waste, and vent piping materials; Water heating equipment; and Location of main water supply shutoff device. The home inspector shall operate all plumbing fixtures, including their faucets and all exterior faucets attached to the house, except where the flow end of the faucet is connected to an appliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; State the effectiveness of anti-siphon devices; Determine whether water supply and waste disposal systems are public or private; Operate automatic safety controls; Operate any valve except water closet flush valves, fixture faucets, and hose faucets; Observe: Water conditioning systems; Fire and lawn sprinkler systems; On-site water supply quantity and quality; On-site waste disposal systems; Foundation irrigation systems; Spas, except as to functional flow and functional drainage; Swimming pools; Solar water heating equipment; or Observe the system for proper sizing, design, or use of proper materials.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps. The home inspector shall describe: Water supply and distribution piping materials; Drain, waste, and vent piping materials; Water heating equipment; and Location of main water supply shutoff device. The home inspector shall operate all plumbing fixtures, including their faucets and all exterior faucets attached to the house, except where the flow end of the faucet is connected to an appliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector is not required to:&lt;/STRONG&gt; State the effectiveness of anti-siphon devices; Determine whether water supply and waste disposal systems are public or private; Operate automatic safety controls; Operate any valve except water closet flush valves, fixture faucets, and hose faucets; Observe: Water conditioning systems; Fire and lawn sprinkler systems; On-site water supply quantity and quality; On-site waste disposal systems; Foundation irrigation systems; Spas, except as to functional flow and functional drainage; Swimming pools; Solar water heating equipment; or Observe the system for proper sizing, design, or use of proper materials.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

In most areas, the liners for wood burning stoves or fireplaces cannot share the&amp;nbsp;liner with other fuel burning type units such as Gas.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Unless you can clearly see all of the&amp;nbsp;liner from end to end, use the&amp;nbsp;auto-comment that the chimney liner was not inspected&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6.

Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a&amp;nbsp;fireplace that has had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the&amp;nbsp;roof on the&amp;nbsp;shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner&amp;nbsp;is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it&amp;nbsp;to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the&amp;nbsp;insert to its&amp;nbsp;liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the&amp;nbsp;insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the home. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting the insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Baths)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;2.&lt;/EM&gt; Is there a duplex grounded outlet?&amp;nbsp;If not recommend a GFCI when electrician corrects.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The light fixture outlet in the&amp;nbsp;bath should be disabled if not grounded.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. There should be at least two outlets in each room.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Note any ceiling fans that wobble more than expected&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Are there any electric outlets located on the&amp;nbsp;wall above the&amp;nbsp;electric baseboard, which is a possible fire hazard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The inspection item CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES is for miscellaneous electrical items found around the property.&amp;nbsp;(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). 
&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.&amp;nbsp; It should still trip by pressing the test button on the&amp;nbsp;outlet, and kill the circuit. 
&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it&amp;nbsp;to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the&amp;nbsp;three-prong &lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. 
&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. 
&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). 
&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the&amp;nbsp;end of the plug when the&amp;nbsp;outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only&amp;nbsp;one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new&amp;nbsp;ground wire. 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners&amp;nbsp;frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>PLUMBING  DRAIN, WASTE and VENT SYSTEMS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New home)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at the basket strainer or waste line connections?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sinks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; Is the&amp;nbsp;waste line a P-trap? Is it vented?&amp;nbsp; Are there shut-off valves under the&amp;nbsp;sink?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Did you pull back insulation under the&amp;nbsp;bathroom floors and other areas with plumbing to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the&amp;nbsp;washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch&amp;nbsp;then note the possibility that&amp;nbsp; newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. 
&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a&amp;nbsp;1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. 
&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department&amp;nbsp;on this issue. 
&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. 
&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.&amp;nbsp; A repair would be to install&amp;nbsp;a GFCI outlet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).&amp;nbsp; They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. 
&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.
