		<comText>FI, Branch circuit wiring in older homes: Homes built before 1930 may have older branch circuit wiring of the type referred to as &amp;quot;knob and tube&amp;quot; wiring. No active knob and tube wire was observed, however there is still a possibility that there would be such wire present in concealed areas. If you have knob and tube wiring in concealed areas, you may discover it when making alterations to the property. Knob and tube wiring can be unsafe if mishandled, damaged, or if it has other materials (such as insulation) in contact with it, and does not have an equipment ground. It may also restrict your ability to insulate in such areas, and circuit wiring should be upgraded in these areas. Other older wiring may also be present, and replacement of older wiring may be necessary if wiring is found to be too brittle, deteriorated, or cannot be used when updating or repairing a circuit. You should be prepared to replace wiring in these areas in the event that such wiring is found. Further investigation is suggested.

Remove mulch and lower the grade so the siding, deck skirting and any wood is not in contact with grade. Maintain 8-inches of exposed foundation between the finished grade and siding/trim. The grade should drop 6-inches over the first 10-feet away from the building. A finished grade of gravel, 12-to-18 inches wide, is recommended around the perimeter of the foundation.

Roof coverings and skylights can appear to be without leaks during inspection and weather conditions. The inspector makes an attempt to find leaks or evidence of leaks but sometimes cannot. Roofs can leak at any time and sometimes without warning.</comText>

		<comName>JTM - LI Cast-Iron Waste?</comName>
		<comText>FI, FR: There was no access to view the main waste piping. If the piping to the sewer is cast-iron, the piping has most likely reached its average life expectancy, and it is not possible to predict the remaining life of such piping. It is common for old cast-iron piping to develop cracking, corrosion, collapsed sections, or tree roots growing into them. If present, expect that repairs or replacement may be necessary in the near to future. It is recommended the clean out area be made accessible to help determine the type and condition of the waste piping to the sewer. If the piping is cast-iron, it is suggested that you have a drain contractor do a video camera sewer lateral inspection now if the waste line is cast-iron. The contractor will run a camera through the waste piping to evaluate the condition and check for blockages, damaged or collapsed sections, and repair or clean out as necessary.

Recommendations to repair, replace, or for further investigation suggest a second opinion and/or further inspection by a qualified contractor or specialist.&amp;#160;Costs associated with this should be considered &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;prior to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; signing a purchase and sale agreement and before the expiration of the inspection contingency period. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please read this report including embedded internet links and/or attachments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographs in this report are representative of condition(s) that may also be found in other areas in the property.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;Not all comments will have a photograph. The presence or absence of a photograph has no bearing on the significance of the condition observed. See comments for complete descriptions of defects or problems. Designations in the report (right, left, front, back, etc.) are to be interpreted as from the front of the property, facing the building, unless otherwise stated in the comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THIS INSPECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inspection was performed in accordance with and under the terms of our &lt;a href="http://www.mkchomeinspection.com/agreement.html"&gt;Property Inspection agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The inspection was also conducted in accordance with the Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/regulations/266-CMR-6-standards-of-practice"&gt;Standards of Practice&lt;/a&gt; for Home Inspectors (MA regulations 266 CMR). Please note that there are limitations and exclusions to the home inspection that are indicated in the Standards of Practice. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not a code inspection, engineering study, or architectural study. We do not inspect for, quote, or enforce building codes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inspecting components such as cabinets, doors, windows, or testing receptacles and other components where there are multiple similar components, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a representative number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these items is tested or inspected. Defects observed may be present on multiple other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a comprehensive analysis of the property, please keep in mind that no house is perfect. All properties have conditions that require repair as well as ongoing maintenance. Also please keep in mind that there is a possibility of hidden or concealed damage that we will not be able to see because this inspection is limited to accessible areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note about mold and indoor air quality: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not inspect or test for mold or indoor air quality. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will indicate if we observe staining that appears to be mold. We also recommend that you have any suspect material tested for type and toxicity by a qualified indoor air quality specialist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have any health concerns or allergies related to mold, it is recommended that you consult with an indoor air quality specialist to test for mold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; If there are areas where there is water and/or moisture infiltration into the building, this is considered a conducive condition for mold growth, and there may be mold present in areas not accessible or visible. Further investigation into concealed areas is recommended in these cases, and any suspect material found should be tested and mitigated as necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also see the attached Home Maintenance, Safety and Efficiency Upgrade sheet. This is intended as a guide to assist you in maintaining your home on a regular basis, adding additional safety features that may not already be present in your home, and upgrading your home to operate more efficiently, resulting in lower utility costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS IN THIS REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspected:&lt;/strong&gt; The inspector visually observed the item, component or unit.

Components or systems that can be repaired to satisfactory condition may not need replacement. It is recommended that you have the scope of the repair evaluated and repaired by the appropriate qualified specialist. This comment may also include minor or maintenance items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(LI) Limited Inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspection of this component is limited or not possible. Inspection may be limited due to lack of visibility or access, weather, or other conditions. These conditions can sometimes conceal a defect in a component. Conditions causing these limitations should be corrected now and inspection or testing be made possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FI) Further Investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Further investigation of this component should be made NOW by the appropriate specialist, with the entire scope of necessary repairs determined, and repairs made as needed. This comment will be used if: The scope of he repair is unknown; there is a potential for and it is suspected that there is additional concealed damage; and/or the subject area is beyond the inspector's expertise. There may also be related defect(s) that are concealed. Items marked with this comment may require repair or replacement if found to be defective or if other problems are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FR) Future Repair:&lt;/strong&gt; This item is currently functioning, but may fail or require significant repair or replacement in the very near to medium term. You should anticipate that this item will need repair or replacement at any time. It is not possible to predict any components' lifespan or remaining service life. Components or systems can sometimes fail without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NP) Not Present:&lt;/strong&gt; This component is not present on the property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When repairs or further investigation are recommended, the suggested contractor or professional is indicated in [brackets].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Massachusetts residential real estate transaction, Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detectors must be present in the home at the time of transfer of ownership. Installation and verification of all detectors in the home is the responsibility of the seller of the property. Inspection and testing of these units must be completed by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department, and coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in residential structures with enclosed parking or combustion heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&amp;#160;and in common areas as well as bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/carbon-monoxide/carbon-monoxide-fact-sheet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications. UL information can be found &lt;a href="http://www.ul.com/code-authorities/fire-code/smoke-alarms-and-smoke-detectors/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not verify property lines, setbacks, rights of way, deeded accesses, property usage types, property development restrictions, flood zone areas, wetlands, or any other zoning or land use ordinances. It is recommended that you obtain a survey of the property as well as a municipal plot plan. Historical information about the property may also be useful. Check with the local municipal building department to review the file on this property for any permits that have been pulled for work on the property. If work has been completed on this property that requires a permit that was never obtained, or that has a permit that has not been signed off on, then it may result in added costs and responsibility to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make repairs or improvements to this property, use proper personal protection, safe practices, and obtain all necessary permitting for such work. Repairs that you make or contract for this property should comply with applicable requirements of the governing codes and sound construction practices, and should be completed by a licensed professional. &lt;strong&gt;Keep in mind that the systems of the home are interrelated. This means that repairs or modifications to one system may affect other system(s).&amp;#160; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homes built prior to today's standards: Conditions may be present in homes that are not conforming to today's standards or codes. These conditions would be considered pre-existing, non-conforming (do not meet current standards). In most residential situations where this is present, the home is not required to be made to conform to today's building code. This should not prevent you from improving any conditions in the home that are potentially unsafe or unsound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old building materials and outdated construction methods: This is an aged home, and there may be old building materials, systems, or building methods that are outdated, obsolete, potentially unsafe, or do not meet modern standards for proper construction methods. &lt;strong&gt;Also- you should be aware that a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reas of the property that are concealed may have conditions not identified in the report (because they are not observable). You should use caution and safe practices when working on or renovating the home, and make improvements as necessary should any suspect materials or construction methods be discovered in the process. It is also common that when repairing or replacing components, the scope of the project can increase due to the age and type of the system(s) and/or due to changes in acceptable practices. Additionally, please be aware that insurance companies can sometimes request upgrades to systems for homeowner or master insurance policies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Structural note:&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It is common to find issues in old homes such as sagging floors, sloping floors, cracks in walls, cracks in foundations, doors rubbing, or jambs out of square. Of course, we will let you know if we believe any conditions observed in the home require repair, replacement, or further investigation by a specialist; however, you should be aware that some amount of this is normal and considered acceptable, and without need of structural repair. If any conditions observed in the home are a concern to you based on conditions at the time of the inspection or after reading this report, we'd recommend getting a second opinion now by a structural engineer to clarify any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FI: This building was built before 1978 (Lead use in paint was banned in 1978). There may be paint on surfaces on the interior and exterior that can contain lead. Lead is a health hazard if ingested.&amp;#160;Testing for lead is beyond the scope of this inspection. It is recommended that you test the home for lead and follow the EPA guidelines for home repair and maintenance if paint contains lead, as well as any applicable laws. See: &lt;a href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead"&gt;EPA website for lead in homes&lt;/a&gt; and also: &lt;a href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/renovation-repair-and-painting-program-consumers"&gt;EPA Website for the Renovation Repair and Painting Rule implemented for homeowners and contractors working on any home built prior to 1978&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A radon in air test was set up at the time of the inspection using a continuous radon monitor. The results will be available within 48 hours of device pickup. We will email a report with results interpretation as soon as the results are available.</comText>

If the distance of the siding is too low off of the roof, moisture damage may result. While the siding was installed off of the roof surfaces, there are several areas that may not conform to installation procedures of the manufacturer. It is recommended that the siding manufacturer be identified and installation guidelines and procedures be followed per manuals.</comText>

		<comName>JTM Asbestos on piping</comName>
		<comText>FI: Heat piping in the basement&amp;#160;has insulation that may contain asbestos. Though we did not test the insulation material to determine that it contains asbestos, this material should be treated as such until a certified asbestos inspector has made a determination. Asbestos found on piping is friable and particles can become air-borne if the material is disturbed. Asbestos is&amp;#160;unhealthy to breathe and may cause severe health issues. Do not remove or disturb this material further without testing it and following proper regulations. Further investigation and testing&amp;#160;by an asbestos specialist is recommended to test this material, as well as locate all suspected materials, and remove as necessary. Removal should be completed following all applicable regulations. Also keep in mind that there may be additional insulation of this type on piping in concealed areas. [Asbestos Testing Specialist] [Asbestos Mitigation Specialist] &lt;p&gt;Additional note: After all asbestos insulation is removed, new insulation should be installed on pipping, using current materials and best practices.</comText>

		<comName>ASB popcorn ceiling text</comName>
		<comText>FI: There is a textured ceiling coating in rooms. This type of coating on the ceiling may contain asbestos. The use of asbestos in this type of application was banned in 1990. EPA recommends that asbestos containing materials that are in good condition and undisturbed be left undisturbed. If the coating does get disturbed, it could release asbestos fibers into the air. Because this type of ceiling coating can crumble if damaged, as it ages, or if it becomes damp, it should be tested and removed or properly covered to prevent any adverse exposure to the material if it does contain asbestos. Testing of these textured ceilings is recommended, contact an asbestos testing specialist for further investigation, to locate any additional areas of asbestos containing materials. Mitigation should be completed as necessary following applicable regulations.

It is recommended that the lead water main be replaced with a new main. [Excavation Contractor] &lt;p&gt;Also see MWRA website for information regarding lead in water supply. At a minimum, use of a water filtration system (that filters lead) for drinking water in the water supply is recommended, and run the water 20-30 seconds before using (run water until the water runs fresh and cold), as per MWRA recommendations.

It is common for old piping like this to develop cracking, corrosion, collapsed sections, or tree roots growing into them. You should expect that you will have to make repairs or replacements in the near future. It is suggested that you have a drain contractor do a video camera sewer lateral inspection now.

The sump pump had not switched on at that level, and then was manually operated by the real estate agent. This means that it is not possible to know if the sump pump did not activate because the switch is broken or because the level of the water had not yet triggered the float switch. Either way, the water level is very high. Having a very high water level in the sump well such as this is a high water table concern. It means that the area ground water level is very high below the concrete slab floor and may flood the basement under certain conditions. &lt;p&gt;This means that additional measures need to be taken to help minimize flooding, and that you should be aware that the risk of flooding can not be eliminated. An additional backup pump should be installed, battery backup power supply installed, and the level of the sump pump further investigated to adjust to a proper level and/or to repair the pump activation float switch if needed.&amp;#160; Please note that water table cannot be adjusted, the only thing that can be done is to add measures to help minimize the chances ofjameson flooding into the basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Basement Waterproofing Contractor]</comText>

		<comText>FI, FR: The main waste piping is aged cast iron. This piping is approaching its average life expectancy. It is not possible to predict the remaining life of the waste piping. It is common for old caste iron piping to develop cracking, corrosion, collapsed sections and damage from tree root growth. You should expect that you will have to make repairs or replacements in the near future. It is suggested that you have a drain contractor do a video camera sewer lateral inspection now. The contractor will run a camera through the waste piping to evaluate the condition and check for blockages, damaged or collapsed sections, and repair and clear out the piping as necessary.

		<comName>~JTM: Balloon Framing</comName>
		<comText>RR: The wall structure is balloon framing. Wall cavities can extend from the basement up to the top floors with this style of framing. This condition that can allow fire to spread more easily. It is recommended that these opening be sealed in the basement to help prevent fire spread. Fire blocking needs to be added over the sill, between stud bays. Adding insulation approved for fire blocking in these areas is good way to increase energy efficiency and improve fire safety. &lt;p&gt;It is recommended that you look into having a free energy audit by MassSave, and explore what energy efficiency programs are available, particularly for insulating along the sill areas of the basement with insulation rated for fire blocking.</comText>

If you have knob and tube wiring in concealed areas, you may discover it when making alterations to the property. Knob and tube wiring can be unsafe if mishandled, damaged, or if it has other materials (such as insulation) in contact with it, and does not have an equipment ground. It may also restrict your ability to insulate in such areas, and circuit wiring should be upgraded in these areas. Other older wiring may also be present, and replacement of older wiring may be necessary if wiring is found to be too brittle, deteriorated, or cannot be used when updating or repairing a circuit. You should be prepared to replace wiring in these areas in the event that such wiring is found.

		<comText>FI, Branch circuit wiring pre-1925: Old, abandoned knob and tube wiring was observed in the *LOCATION(room-space/areas)*. This suggests that there is a possibility of additional active knob and tube wire in other parts of the home/building. If you have knob and tube wiring in concealed areas, you may discover it when making alterations to the property. Knob and tube wiring can be unsafe if mishandled, damaged, or if it has other materials (such as insulation) in contact with it, and does not have an equipment ground. It may also restrict your ability to insulate in such areas, and circuit wiring should be upgraded in these areas. Other old wiring may also be present, and replacement of this wiring may be necessary if wiring is found to be too brittle, deteriorated, or cannot be used when updating or repairing a circuit. You should be prepared to replace wiring in these areas in the event that such wiring is found. Further investigation is suggested.

		<comText>Old building materials and outdated construction methods: This is an aged home, and there may be old building materials, systems, or building methods that are outdated, obsolete, potentially unsafe, or do not meet modern standards for proper construction methods. Also- you should be aware that areas of the property that are concealed may have conditions not identified in the report (because they are not observable). You should use caution and safe practices when working on or renovating the home and make improvements as necessary should any suspect materials or construction methods be discovered in the process. It is also common that when repairing or replacing components, the scope of the project can increase due to the age and type of the system(s) and/or due to changes in acceptable practices. Additionally, please be aware that insurance companies can sometimes request upgrades to systems for homeowner or master insurance policies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural note:&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt; It is common to find issues in old homes such as sagging floors, sloping floors, cracks in walls, cracks in foundations, doors rubbing, or jambs out of square. Of course, we will let you know if we believe any conditions observed in the home require repair, replacement, or further investigation by a specialist; however, you should be aware that some amount of this is normal and considered acceptable, and without need of structural repair. If any conditions observed in the home are a concern to you based on conditions at the time of the inspection or after reading this report, we'd recommend getting a second opinion now by a structural engineer to clarify any issues.</comText>

		<comText>Not Tested: Induction cooking heats a cooking vessel by magnetic induction, instead of by thermal conduction from a flame, or an electrical heating element. For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. However, copper, glass, non-magnetic stainless steels, and aluminum vessels could be used if placed on a separately obtained ferromagnetic interface disk which functions as a conventional hotplate. We did not test this appliance because it requires handling homeowners pots and pans etc... Ask the seller to explain and demonstrate. (FYI: You might want to buy all new pots and pans!)</comText>

Obtain a financial statement for the condo association to determine the balance of the reserves and other financial information. Obtain a copy of minutes from a recent association meeting if possible, and check to see if condo association is planning any new assessments or changes to condo fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that condominium associations be prepared and allocate funds in reserve for emergency repairs and regular maintenance. This may help to minimize unexpected assessments and allow the association to engage in effective preventative maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, condominium associations should maintain a pest control plan for regular inspections of the property and treatment as necessary. Verify with the association that a pest control plan is in place.</comText>

Inspection and testing of these units is made by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department. Coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller and/or the seller's agent. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in all residential structures with enclosed parking and/or heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&amp;#160; and outside bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/injury/carbon_monoxide_fact_sheet.htm&lt;/a&gt; It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications.

		<comText>FI: Conditions were not favorable for an accurate radon test. In order to perform a proper radon test following EPA protocol, all windows and doors in the entire home must be closed 12 hours before and remain closed during the entire test period. Often times it is very difficult to perform an accurate test if people living in the building do not have air conditioning. This can cause people to open windows, invalidating test results. It is recommended that the association contract a radon measurement professional to provide radon testing to the entire property when proper test conditions can be met, and mitigation be installed as necessary.

This is not a code inspection, engineering study, or architectural study. We do not inspect for, quote, or enforce building codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inspecting components such as cabinets, doors, windows, or testing receptacles and other components where there are multiple similar components, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a representative number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these items is tested or inspected. Defects observed may be present on multiple other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a comprehensive analysis of the property, please keep in mind that no house is perfect. All properties have conditions that require repair as well as ongoing maintenance. Also, please keep in mind that there is a possibility of hidden or concealed damage that we will not be able to see because this inspection is limited to accessible areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note about mold and indoor air quality: We do not inspect or test for mold or indoor air quality. We will indicate if we observe staining that appears to be mold. We also recommend that you have any suspect material tested for type and toxicity by a qualified indoor air quality specialist. If you have any health concerns or allergies related to mold, it is recommended that you consult with an indoor air quality specialist to test for mold. If there are areas where there is water and/or moisture infiltration into the building, this is considered a conducive condition for mold growth, and there may be mold present in areas not accessible or visible. Further investigation into concealed areas is recommended in these cases, and any suspect material found should be tested and mitigated as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also see the attached Home Maintenance, Safety and Efficiency Upgrade sheet.

Components or systems that can be repaired to satisfactory condition may not need replacement. It is recommended that you have the scope of the repair evaluated and repaired by the appropriate qualified specialist. This comment may also include minor or maintenance items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(LI) Limited Inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspection of this component is limited or not possible. Inspection may be limited due to lack of visibility or access, weather, or other conditions. These conditions can sometimes conceal a defect in a component. Conditions causing these limitations should be corrected now and inspection or testing be made possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FI) Further Investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Further investigation of this component should be made NOW by the appropriate specialist, with the entire scope of necessary repairs determined, and repairs made as needed. This comment will be used if: The scope of the repair is unknown; there is a potential for and it is suspected that there is additional concealed damage; and/or the subject area is beyond the inspector's expertise. There may also be related defect(s) that are concealed. Items marked with this comment may require repair or replacement if found to be defective or if other problems are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(FR) Future Repair:&lt;/strong&gt; This item is currently functioning but may fail or require significant repair or replacement in the very near to medium term. You should anticipate that this item will need repair or replacement at any time. It is not possible to predict any components' lifespan or remaining service life. Components or systems can sometimes fail without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NP) Not Present:&lt;/strong&gt; This component is not present on the property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When repairs or further investigation are recommended, the suggested contractor or professional is indicated in [brackets].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Massachusetts residential real estate transaction, Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detectors must be present in the home at the time of transfer of ownership. Installation and verification of all detectors in the home is the responsibility of the seller of the property. Inspection and testing of these units must be completed by a Fire Marshall of the local Fire department, and coordination of this inspection is the responsibility of the seller. Massachusetts law requires carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in residential structures with enclosed parking or combustion heating equipment. Installation of CO and Smoke detectors is recommended on all floors, in utility areas,&amp;#160;and in common areas as well as bedrooms. Further information about CO can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/carbon-monoxide/carbon-monoxide-fact-sheet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended that you follow UL safety guidelines and detector manufacturer specifications. UL information can be found &lt;a href="http://www.ul.com/code-authorities/fire-code/smoke-alarms-and-smoke-detectors/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not verify property lines, setbacks, rights of way, deeded accesses, property usage types, property development restrictions, flood zone areas, wetlands, or any other zoning or land use ordinances. It is recommended that you obtain a survey of the property as well as a municipal plot plan. Historical information about the property may also be useful. Check with the local municipal building department to review the file on this property for any permits that have been pulled for work on the property. If work has been completed on this property that requires a permit that was never obtained, or that has a permit that has not been signed off on, then it may result in added costs and responsibility to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make repairs or improvements to this property, use proper personal protection, safe practices, and obtain all necessary permitting for such work. Repairs that you make or contract for this property should comply with applicable requirements of the governing codes and sound construction practices and should be completed by a licensed professional. Keep in mind that the systems of the home are interrelated. This means that repairs or modifications to one system may affect other system(s).&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homes built prior to today's standards: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Conditions may be present in homes that are not conforming to today's standards or codes. These conditions would be considered pre-existing, non-conforming (do not meet current standards). In most residential situations where this is present, the home is not required to be made to conform to today's building code. This should not prevent you from improving any conditions in the home that are potentially unsafe or unsound.</comText>

		<comText>RR, FI: The chimney flue that vents the boiler is blocked by debris in and above the cleanout opening. The flue was not visible from below due to this debris.

		<comText>FI: The gas piping running from the meters to the units is corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST). The accessible CSST was observed to be manufactured by Ward, and is labelled &amp;quot;Wardflex&amp;quot;. There is currently a class action lawsuit in place for some types of CSST installed as of 2006. &amp;quot;Ward&amp;quot;&amp;#160; is one of the manufacturers involved in this lawsuit. This lawsuit was developed because it appears that CSST may be vulnerable to damage (if it is not properly bonded) in the event of a lightning strike, and so the material should have added lightning protection, grounding, and bonding. &lt;p&gt;As a result of the lawsuit, the association and its members may be eligible for a benefit to provide the adequate lightning protection, grounding and bonding to the CSST that is recommended. It is&amp;#160; recommended that you verify with the association if they have entered into this lawsuit as a member. More information regarding the class action lawsuit can be found at: http://www.pddocs.com/csst/faq.aspx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Electrician]</comText>

		<comText>Please see the embedded Standards of Practice and Definitions (MA 266 CMR) at the end of this report for the complete description of the scope of the inspection of this system. Keep in mind that older homes may have piping in varying degrees of wear. Leakage may be present in concealed areas and may not be able to be detected if no visible signs are present. Also keep in mind that aged waste piping may require periodic maintenance clearing or replacement. Additionally, if this property has a private septic and/or a private well, inspection of these components is not included in this inspection. Septic systems will require a Title 5 inspection and private wells should have a well inspection, well test, and a comprehensive water quality test performed. FUEL OIL TANKS: Above-ground oil storage tanks (ASTs) and Underground oil storage tanks (USTs) are excluded from this inspection. Any tanks present on this property should be evaluated by an oil tank provider that utilizes the &amp;quot;TankSure&amp;quot; program for measurement of fuel oil tank wall thickness and condition. We observe areas in and around oil storage tanks that are accessible and look for signs of any USTs present on the property. Keep in mind that the absence of signs of a UST is not a guarantee that there is no UST on the property.</comText>
