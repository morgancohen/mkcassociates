		<comText>The Plumbing or water supply was off during this inspection. The items or components that were not inspected because water was off are: 1. The water pressure or volume and whether it was adequate. 2. Any odors or color in water that may indicate a filter or correction is needed. 3. Any water filtration or flush systems. 4. Whether or not Hot and Cold is reversed on any faucets. 5. Water temperature. 6. Functional flow (whether or not is adequate) 7. Plumbing fixtures or piping that may leak or drip. 8. Waste line and drainage 9. Noisy piping or whether plumbing vents are working or not. 10. Whether or not the water heater will leak. Sometimes T&amp;amp;P valve can leak but only after water heater has been on for 24 hours or more. 11. Heat systems that require water such as boilers that use radiators cannot be inspected without allowing the radiators to work fully. Some radiators that are old may take hours to fully work. Turning the electric on briefly will not allow a good inspection of these radiators. Some radiators will leak but only after sufficient time to allow for radiators to fully work has occurred. 12. Heat systems that require water such as Hydronic cannot be inspected without water and electricity 13. Jet powered tubs cannot be inspected without water. There is a re-inspection fee to return and inspect should water be turned on. The inspection is not responsible for any item that is not working properly or was not inspected due to no water.</comText>

		<comName>old building</comName>
		<comText>This building is older than 50 years and the building inspector considers this while inspecting. It is common to have areas that no longer comply with current code. This is not a new building and this building cannot be expected to meet current code standards. While this inspection makes every effort to point out safety issues, it does not inspect for code. It is common that homes of any age will have had repairs performed and some repairs may not be in a workmanlike manner. Some areas may appear less than standard. This inspection looks for items that are not functioning as intended. It does not grade the repair. It is common to see old plumbing or mixed materials. Sometimes water signs in crawlspaces or basements could be years old from a problem that no longer exists. Or, it may still need further attention and repair. Determining this can be difficult on an older building. Sometimes in older homes there are signs of damage to wood from wood eating insects. Having this is typical and fairly common. If the building inspection reveals signs of damage you should have a pest control company inspect further for activity and possible hidden damage. The building inspection does not look for possible manufacturer re-calls on components that could be in this building. Always consider hiring the appropriate expert for any repairs or further inspection.</comText>

		<comName>std wh used as hydro</comName>
		<comText>Your water heater serves not only to provide domestic hot water (i.e. bathing, dishes, cooking etc.) but also provides the heat for the building (Hydronic). Hydronic water heaters have a higher BTU or ability to heat water hotter than a"Standard" water heater. However your water heater is a "Standard" water heater modified to also heat your building. This means that some Heating Contractors or Public Service Gas companies may differ on opinion as to whether or not this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the building. Because this Standard water heater has been in place for sometime, one can infer that if it was not adequately heating the building, the previous owners more than likely would have replaced it with a "Hydronic" water heater. I am unable to determine if this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the building and recommend you obtain a second opinion.</comText>

		<comName>Alum wiring long desc</comName>
		<comText>Aluminum wire is installed on 120 VAC branch electrical circuits in the subject house. These single strand, branch circuit aluminum wires were used widely in houses during the mid 1960s and 1970s. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, problems due to expansion can cause overheating at connections between the wire and devices (switches and outlets) or at splices, which has resulted in fires. For further information on aluminum wiring contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission via the Internet at &lt;A href="http://www.cpsc.gov/"&gt;http://www.cpsc.gov/&lt;/A&gt; .

		<comName>clay liners oil now gas</comName>
		<comText>Clay liners that once were used with oil furnaces, and are now being used for venting gas or propane furnaces or water heaters may deteriorate called "Spalling." This is from oil residue absorbed in the liner that breaks down from the gas residue. Because of this potential problem, most chimney sweeps will eventually recommend a liner replacement. For this reason, I recommend a qualified chimney sweep inspect for safety.</comText>

		<comName>Plumbing</comName>
		<comText>The plumbing in the building was inspected and reported on with the above information. While the inspector makes every effort to find all areas of concern, some areas can go unnoticed. Washing machine drain line for example cannot be checked for leaks or the ability to handle the volume during drain cycle. Older homes with galvanized supply lines or cast iron drain lines can be obstructed and barely working during an inspection but then fails under heavy use. If the water is turned off or not used for periods of time (like a vacant building waiting for closing) rust or deposits within the pipes can further clog the piping system. Please be aware that the inspector has your best interest in mind. Any repair items mentioned in this report should be considered before purchase. It is recommended that qualified contractors be used in your further inspection or repair issues as it relates to the comments in this inspection report.</comText>

I recommend checking the gutters and the downspout drain lines for proper operation. Also, a water proofing paint could be applied to the interior side of the block if necessary. Efflorescence is found on many homes without water intrusion occurring inside the building. But, it should alert you to the possibility that future steps may be needed.</comText>

The level of due diligence should be set where the cost, in time and money, of acquiring information about the subject property will not likely exceed the value of that information. Therefore an inspection performed in accordance with this standard will not be technically exhaustive. In recognizing that the client likely has the goal of acquiring information about the subject property at a cost, in time and money, that does not exceed the value of that information, representative observations are not just permitted by this standard, but recommended as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The client should understand that no inspection report is completely accurate.&amp;#160; A report is only the written communication of the observations made and research conducted by the inspector.&amp;#160; The report contains those items which in the inspector's opinion are likely to be of interest to his/her client.&amp;#160; The client should understand that the inspection report is, to a large degree, the subjective opinions of the inspector based on his/her observations and research within the limits of access, time, and budget and without the aid of special equipment or meters and without dismantling, probing, testing, or troubleshooting and without detailed knowledge of the commercial property, its components or its systems.&amp;#160; The inspection report is not much more than a subjective professional opinion. An inspector performing a commercial inspection in accordance with this standard is not practicing architecture or engineering.&amp;#160;This inspection is not a warranty and the inspection report is merely the written communication of the inspector's subjective opinion on the condition of the subject property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of accuracy of information varies depending on its source.&amp;#160; The inspector may rely on information obtained to the extent that the information appears to be accurate and complete. This standard does not require the inspector to independently verify the accuracy of the documents reviewed by the inspector or included in the report nor the statements made by those interviewed by the inspector. The inspector is not a fraud investigator and this standard does not require the inspector to look for intentionally hidden deficiencies in the subject property.&amp;#160; The inspection report is supplementary to the seller's disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment Key or Definitions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following definitions of comment descriptions represent this inspection report. All comments by the inspector should be considered before purchasing this building. Any recommendations by the inspector to repair or replace suggests a second opinion or further inspection by a qualified contractor. All costs associated with further inspection fees and repair or replacement of item, component or unit should be considered before you purchase the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Inspected (IN)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = I visually observed the item, component or unit and if no other comments were made then it appeared to be functioning as intended allowing for normal wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Not Inspected (NI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;= I did not inspect this item, component or unit and made no representations of whether or not it was functioning as intended and will state a reason for not inspecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Not Present (NP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = This item, component or unit is not in this building or building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Repair or Replace (RR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = The item, component or unit is not functioning as intended, or needs further inspection by a qualified contractor. Items, components or units that can be repaired to satisfactory condition may not need replacement.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>&amp;ldquo;Green&amp;rdquo; describes features, technologies and products that increase efficiency in a building&amp;rsquo;s energy and water usage, help protect the health of its occupants, and reduce the commercial property&amp;rsquo;s impact on the environment.&amp;#160; Green buildings are healthier, more environmentally friendly, and economically smarter than average buildings.&amp;#160; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green features: improve energy efficiency,reduce pollution, provide healthier air, increase comfort reduce water usage, preserve natural resources, increase durability, make a building quieter, reduce maintenance, lower monthly costs, improve resale value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codes and standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all green building codes and standards have been developed by private organizations and pertain to new construction, not existing commercial properties.&amp;#160; Nevertheless, existing properties, by design, by luck, or through modification, have green features that clients should know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This standard does not require the inspector to determine the &amp;ldquo;green-ness&amp;rdquo; of a building. The purpose of the green features report is to permit the inspector to easily point out common green features of the property thus increasing client awareness of the property's green features. The inspector is not required to perform an energy audit, determine code compliance, perform environmental assessments, test for radon, lead, asbestos or mold, or report on all green features or the lack of them (see 8.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional add-on inspection service &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This standard does not require the inspector to perform this green features inspection.&amp;#160; The observed green features report may be offered as an additional inspection service in conjunction with a complete commercial building inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following checklist is designed to help identify commonly found green features noticed by the inspector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y = Yes&lt;/strong&gt; This feature was observed and may exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N = No&lt;/strong&gt; This feature was not observed and so might not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U = Unknown&lt;/strong&gt; Inspector did not note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N/A&lt;/strong&gt; = Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

Inspect for or determine shear stress. Determine lag screw or bolt shear values. Calculate loads. Determine proper spans or inspect for deflections. Discover decay hidden by paint. Verify that flashing has been coated to prevent corrosion. Determine that post to footing attachments exists. Dig below grade or remove soil around posts. Crawl under any deck with less than 3 feet headroom or remove deck skirting to acquire access. Determine proper footing depth or frost line. Verify proper footing size. Perform pick tests. Perform or provide any architectural or engineering service. Use a level or plum bob. Use a moisture meter. Predict service life expectancy. Verify compliance with permits, codes or formal standards. Inspect for disabled persons accessibility barriers. Determine if deck blocks, covers, or hinders septic tank or plumbing access. Determine easement encroachment compliance.</comText>

		<comName>Pool disclaimer</comName>
		<comText>&lt;P align=left&gt;Pools are fun, but children and adults can lose their life quickly. Over 4000  lives annually are lost with one-third  under the age of 14. &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A child can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; A swimming pool is 14 times more likely than a motor vehicle to be involved in the death of a child age 4 and under. An estimated 5,000 children ages 14 and under are hospitalized due to near-drownings each year; 15 percent die in the hospital and as many as 20 percent suffer severe, permanent brain damage. Of all preschoolers who drown, 70 percent are in the care of one or both parents at the time of the drowning and 75 percent are missing from sight for five minutes or less. Drowning surpasses all other causes of death to children age 14 and under in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A &lt;U&gt;pool alarm&lt;/U&gt; with a loud speaker system to sound outside as well as inside the building could save a life. Even if you do not have children you should be concerned. 35% of children that drowned did so &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in someone else's pool. For more info, do an Internet search on pool safety or visit this website:  &lt;A href="http://www.ihf.org/foryourhealth/article_children.html"&gt;http://www.ihf.org/foryourhealth/article_children.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</comText>

		<comName>5 year homes</comName>
		<comText>Homes more than 5 years old may have areas that are not current in code requirements. This is not a new building and this building cannot be expected to meet current code standards. While this inspection makes every effort to point out safety issues, it does not inspect for code. It is common that homes of any age will have had repairs performed and some repairs may not be in a workmanlike manner. Some areas may appear less than standard. This inspection looks for items that are not functioning as intended. It does not grade the repair. It is sometimes common to see old plumbing or mixed materials. Sometimes water signs in crawlspaces or basements could be years old from a problem that no longer exists. Or, it may still need further attention and repair. Determining this can be difficult in a lived in building. Sometimes homes have signs of damage to wood from wood eating insects. Having this is typical and fairly common. If the building inspection reveals signs of damage you should have a pest control company inspect further for activity and possible hidden damage. The building inspection does not look for possible manufacturer re-calls on components that could be in this building. Always consider hiring the appropriate expert for any repairs or further inspection.</comText>

		<comName>fixer upper</comName>
		<comText>This building is considered a "fixer upper." The building inspection is limited to what can be inspected in regards to floor and wall coverings and general cosmetics. You should be aware of obvious areas that need prep and paint, or replacement of coverings. These items represent the overall condition of building. The inspection of main components is the purpose of this inspection. Components such as structure, roof, plumbing, heating and electrical are main components. Utilities must be on for inspection of these areas. If the inspection report states that a utility is off (no water, no fuel, or no electrical) then any item relating to these components cannot be inspected. Always consider having the utility on in order to inspect these areas. There is a fee for a return trip to re-inspect.</comText>

		<comText>The electricity was off during this inspection. Possible function of items or components that were not inspected because of no electricity: 1. Water heater or water temperature (unless gas powered) 2. Outlets and the polarity of outlets and wall switches. 3. Kitchen appliances 4. Heating system 5. Cooling system(if applicable) 6. Whether or not cold and hot is reversed on faucets 7. Whether or not the water heater will leak. Sometimes T&amp;amp;P valve can leak but only after water heater has been on for 24 hours or more. 8. Heat systems such as boilers that use radiators cannot be inspected without allowing the radiators to work fully. Some radiators that are old may take hours to fully work. Turning the electric on briefly will not allow a good inspection of these radiators. Some radiators will leak but only after sufficient time to allow for radiators to fully work has occurred. 9. Jet powered tubs cannot be inspected without water and electricity. There is a re-inspection fee to return and inspect should power be restored. The inspection is not responsible for any item that is not working properly or was not inspected due to no electricity.</comText>

In severe cold temperatures, you may need to turn temperature setting up on water heater. This will also cause tap water at faucets to become hot.

Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the chimney for integrity and proper seal.&lt;LI&gt; Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any).&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level.&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass.&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule.&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less.

Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat.&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat.&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service.&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant.&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly.&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees.

		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Determine if the stairway should have a handrail. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Any stairway of 4 or more risers should have a handrail on at least one side. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the handrail height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
The height of a handrail is measured vertically from the sloped plane adjoining the tread nosing or leading 
edge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The handrail height should be at least 34 inches and not more than 38 inches. (Exception: If there is a 
continuous handrail transition between flights, the handrail height at the transition can be greater than the 
maximum.) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The handrail height should be at least 800 mm, and not more than 965 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect continuity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
The handrail should be continuous for the full length of the flight of stairs, measured from a point directly 
above the top riser to a point directly above the bottom riser of the flight. Continuity can be interrupted by a 
newel post at a turn. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: A volute, starting easing, or turnout can be installed over the lowest tread. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: A doorway or landing can interrupt continuity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail termination. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Handrails should end at a newel post or a wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Handrails should terminate in a manner that will not obstruct travel or create a hazard. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail clearance. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Handrails adjacent to a wall should have a space of not less than 1 1&amp;frasl;2 inches between the wall and the 
handrails. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Handrails adjacent to a wall should have a space of not less than 50 mm between the wall and the 
handrails, or 60 mm if the surface behind the handrail is rough or abrasive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail attachment to the wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The handrail should have attachment devices to transfer to the structural wall a concentrated load of 200 
pounds applied at any point in any direction. CA: The handrail should have attachment devices to transfer to 
the structural wall a concentrated load of CA: 0.9 kN applied at any point in any direction. The attachment 
points should not be spaced more than 1.2 m apart. The first attachment point should be no more than 300 mm 
from the end of the handrail. If attached to wooden structural components, the fasteners should consist of at 
least 2 wood screws at each point, penetrating at least 32 mm into solid wood.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<iiText>WALLS (interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Walls can tell you a lot about the house. Settlement cracks should be noted as minor or significant in relation to the structure or to the wall covering, as whether or not a repair is needed. Note if it is "Cosmetic" after you mention the crack, if you think it's ok. On an old house, push on the wall near a window to see if it gives, if you suspect deterioration or termite damage. Bowed paneling on a wall alerts you to moisture or possible water intrusion. Faint water signs can sometimes be found under windows and along the baseboard. Black flash marks on or around an outlet on the wall should be noted. Recommend a licensed electrician inspect further. EXTERIOR: Circle the house slowly paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along top of garage door and window brick mold. Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green alga areas. Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights&amp;quot;Faint or Dim&amp;quot; and you press the button on the plug and it shows&amp;quot;Reverse polarity,&amp;quot; it may just be a&amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is&amp;quot;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it&amp;quot;Trips,&amp;quot; doesn't mean it&amp;quot;Killed the circuit.&amp;quot; It could be defective. New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Most everyone expects electric 220-volt connection for Dryer. Note if the only connection for dryer is gas. Note if both are available as a plus. Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. Many older homes still have 1&amp;quot;1/2 diameter wasteline and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may over run drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health dept or building safety on this issue. Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. The outlet for washing machine should be grounded if existing. A repair would be a GFCI outlet.</iiHelp>

One radiator could cost $1000 or more easily ($80 a rung so I've heard) so be sure and write up any that do not get hot on both ends as needing servicing or further inspection by a Boiler technician.&lt;LI&gt;Read the auto-comments in the heat section.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inspector should inspect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A. Fireplaces, and open and close the damper doors if readily accessible and operable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B. Hearth extensions and other permanently installed components. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C. And report as in need of repair deficiencies in the lintel, hearth and material surrounding 
the fireplace, including clearance from combustible materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Inspect the flue or vent system. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Inspect the interior of chimneys or flues, fire doors or screens, seals or gaskets, or mantels. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Determine the need for a chimney sweep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Operate gas fireplace inserts. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Light pilot flames. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Inspect automatic fuel feed devices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G. Inspect combustion and/or make-up air devices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H. Inspect heat distribution assists whether gravity controlled or fan assisted. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Ignite or extinguish fires. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Determine draft characteristics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K. Move fireplace inserts, stoves, or firebox contents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L. Determine adequacy of draft, perform a smoke test or dismantle or remove any fireplace 
component.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M. Perform an NFPA inspection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N. Determine the appropriateness of any installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Verify if using gas or propane logs by ID plate. A fork shaped flame nozzle usually means vented 
and a straw shaped nozzle usually means non-vented.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2.&lt;em&gt; (Newer Construction)&lt;/em&gt;Make sure that the type of gas logs match the fuel type for the home (i.e. Gas 
logs for natural gas and propane logs for propane gas).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Visually examine fire logs for damage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Black soot build up on logs usually means incorrect placement or arrangement. Refer to Manual 
specifications.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Note if the damper is missing or if the lid does not shut off air completely&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#333333"&gt;
Non&lt;/font&gt;-vented firelogs are not allowed in sleeping rooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always mention this in your report when small coal Fireplace(s) are present. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A lot of Buyers will try to convert old coal FP to gas logs and need to know about venting 
requirements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check the metal ID tag and make sure that the type of fuel at the house matches the type that 
the logs are designed for (Gas or LP). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Verify if using gas or propane logs by ID plate. A fork shaped flame nozzle usually means vented 
and a straw shaped nozzle usually means non-vented.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2.&lt;em&gt; (Newer Construction)&lt;/em&gt;Make sure that the type of gas logs match the fuel type for the home (i.e. Gas 
logs for natural gas and propane logs for propane gas).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Visually examine fire logs for damage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Black soot build up on logs usually means incorrect placement or arrangement. Refer to Manual 
specifications.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Note if the damper is missing or if the lid does not shut off air completely&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#333333"&gt;
Non&lt;/font&gt;-vented firelogs are not allowed in sleeping rooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always mention this in your report when small coal Fireplace(s) are present. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A lot of Buyers will try to convert old coal FP to gas logs and need to know about venting 
requirements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check the metal ID tag and make sure that the type of fuel at the house matches the type that 
the logs are designed for (Gas or LP). &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the handgrip portion of the handrail. It should be graspable along the entire length of the handrail. The 
handgrip shape should provide a graspable surface. It should allow the user to maintain a consistently secure 
natural grasp on the handrail without twisting the fingers or requiring release. The handgrip can be circular or non-circular. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: A circular handgrip should have a cross section minimum of 1 1&amp;frasl;4 inches and a maximum of 2 inches. All 
handrails should be equivalently graspable to the 2-inch circular handgrip. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: A circular handgrip should have a cross section minimum of 30 mm and a maximum of 43 mm. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: A non-circular handgrip with a perimeter minimum of 4 inches and a maximum of 6 1&amp;frasl;4 inches should have a 
maximum cross section of 2 1&amp;frasl;4 inches. A non-circular handgrip with a perimeter greater than 6 1&amp;frasl;4 inches should 
have a graspable finger recess on both sides &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: A non-circular handgrip with a perimeter minimum of 100 mm and a maximum of 125 mm should have a 
maximum cross section of 45 mm. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Note: In my own interpretation of the SOP, I do not think cabinets or countertops are included. 
However, I decided to include it because I am unsure of what should be inferred from the SOP. If you 
want you can Delete it, or select it and the select the EDIT T button at the second toolbar above and 
UN-Exclude by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Check the countertop at sink rim for absorption or damage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Check the backside of drawers at the cabinet base for mold.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Check the wall behind the refrigerator for mold.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Check the Icemaker line behind the refrigerator for kinks or damage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Are there any extra large cut-outs for plumbing or the range vent that may allow air infiltration from 
the attic or crawlspace?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. What is the microwave clearance from the range?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Is the sink base deteriorated or sagging from previous leaks at the bottom shelf?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Does the back splash on the counter behind the sink prevent splash water from possibly going 
behind sink base and causing mold on concealed wall?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
9. Is the kick board missing anywhere in the kitchen cabinetry that may allow trash to collect or 
rodents to enter?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
10. Is the wall cabinetry secure?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
11. Is the shelving warped?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
12. Make sure the island cabinet cannot be moved if a wired outlet is present&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;

&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;For new building construction, it is important to look for workmanship flaws in installation and 
mounting of cabinets or securing the countertop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Cabinets are expensive and you should be aware of high expectations from your client on having 
near perfect workmanship and installations of crown, trim, joining sides of two cabinets, cut-out 
for the dishwasher and cut-outs for the plumbing lines the size of a baseball.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Islands that are moveable but have a wired outlet, should be noted as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The dishwasher needs to be secured under the counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Tile counters should not be sharp or have the cut edge exposed along the counter edge (sharp).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure counters that overhang or extend towards a range top are not to close to the rear 
burner or heating element because of a fire hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Remember, in new construction, there are no excuses for less than near perfect cabinet 
installation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;E. And report on the location of under-floor access openings. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. And report any present conditions or clear indications of active water penetration observed by the 
inspector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;G. For wood in contact or near soil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;H. And report any general indications of foundation movement that are observed by the 
inspector, such as but not limited to sheetrock cracks, brick cracks, out-of-square door frames 
or floor slopes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I. And report on any cutting, notching and boring of framing members which may present a 
structural or safety concern.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Enter any crawlspaces that are not readily accessible or where entry could cause damage 
or pose a hazard to the inspector. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Move stored items or debris. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Operate sump pumps. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Identify size, spacing, span, location or determine adequacy of foundation bolting, 
bracing, joists, joist spans or support systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Perform or provide any engineering or architectural service. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Report on the adequacy of any structural system or component.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Is insulation installed right side up? (Paper side should face the heated space)&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Did you pull back insulation under the bathroom floors to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Note any incomplete X bracing of joists&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Is the main girder supported properly?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Screw jacks used as permanent support might work, but some inspectors will consider them as &amp;quot;for 
temporary use only&amp;quot; and will recommend replacement (FYI).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Is there construction debris or any discontinued appliances, water heaters or furnaces that need to 
be noted in the report?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Note any floor system repairs that used smaller framing materials than existing joists.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Note if joist spacing is 2 feet apart or more which can prevent the installation of insulation or cause 
a bounce in the floor when walked or when heavy furniture is in the room. You may be inspecting a 
vacant building and a bounce or sag in the floor could be discovered after the buyer moves in heavy 
furniture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the floor system: Remove insulation and look at these areas to find the jackpot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Where outside faucets are located .&lt;br /&gt;
2. Where drain lines are installed from baths and kitchen&lt;br /&gt;
3. Where insulation is missing or where newer insulation is installed.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Where exterior doors or patio doors are.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Where decks attach to outer band of floor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other areas to look for are the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;main girder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (termite damage is found often here). Also where wooden 
supports might have allowed moisture and termites to crawl up to floor system. Hanging insulation is a 
sign of moisture condensation if there are several hanging pieces, or a snake. It doesn't hurt to use a 
stab tool on joists every now and then while you are crawling around. Look on the ground or plastic 
barrier for evidence of a repair above. Often there are wood crumbs or small debris that was not 
cleaned up completely.&lt;/p&gt;

		<iiHelp>Look at an old building with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet).

A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but not new construction. The problem occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic or PVC, which removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make sure the electric panel is grounded.&lt;LI&gt; Some electricians say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a ground. I have heard some electricians disagree and say that there is always a way to ground the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that "there is only one ground wire found on the panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed to non-metal and there is no ground". Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the panel. I recommend an electrician add another ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS.&lt;LI&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company.&lt;LI&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard.&lt;LI&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label.&lt;LI&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later it was found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the panel states that no other brand is allowed.&lt;LI&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the form of litigation. Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it.&lt;LI&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself.&lt;LI&gt;Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground.&lt;LI&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electricians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Two prong plugs in the Garage or around any areas with water?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.  &lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Look at an old building with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc.</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is there doubled wiring at circuits? 14 Gauge = 15 amp, 12 Gauge = 20 amp, 10 gauge = 30 amp?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. You must use solid copper tubing wire&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; not strand wire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on 30 amp circuits or less.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Note any fuses in panel that are Edison based (interchangeable).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Are branch circuits labeled, identifying the locations?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Note any circuits that were turned off and not tested during inspection.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Federal Pacific electric panels are unsafe. An excellent source of info is&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inspect-ny.com/"&gt;&amp;#160; www.inspect-ny.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Are you new to Electrical? If so, I recommend studying the basics of wiring and circuit breakers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;14 Gauge=15 amp breakers and 12 gauge=20 amp breakers and so on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Go to Lowe's or Home Depot or your building supply store and hang out in the electrical wiring 
isle. Touch grab and feel. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;You could call up a few different electricians (small outfits) and introduce yourself and your 
company and ask him if he would be interested in coaching you from time to time in exchange 
for referrals or a fee. Until you learn when to recommend an electrician, you can explain to the 
buyer that this wiring method at the panel looks unfamiliar and you want to hold off on your 
condition call until you speak to an electrician. Then call the electrician and ask him. If possible, 
email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn. Pass all panels 
that appear to be wired properly based on what is proper, and recommend an electrician on 
everything else. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Are doorstops or hingestops present?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Do doors close and latch properly?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Check the closet bi-fold door hardware and note whether or not the doors operate properly&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;All doors should latch when closed and note if the jamb rubs, because seasonal change may 
make the door swell and have difficulty closing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Note missing hardware, doorstop, damage etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check bi-folds at the top hardware location for damage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It is common for bi-folds to need adjustment. Failing to note this can sometimes create a phone 
call from the buyer, complaining about the bi-fold doors. Sometimes the opening for a bi-fold 
door needs adjustment which could be significant cosmetic work to correct the opening. &lt;/li&gt;

If there is siding or wood underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to building is to use 5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the building to screw the nuts, then 5/8" galvanized lag screws are better than nothing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>BRANCH CIRCUITS-CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES (Report as in need of repair the lack of ground fault circuit protection where required.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not"Trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can "Trip" a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity," it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is "Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "Trips," doesn't mean it "Killed the circuit." It could be defective.  New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is there a lack of or improper flashing at wall junctions or chimneys?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Does dormer siding have sufficient clearance from the roof? Is it flashed properly?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Flashings are hidden most of the time, but you can go to the roof and wall junctions and tap on 
the shingle to see if it flexes away from the flashing underneath. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Know what step flashing is, along with cap or counter flashing. The cap or counter flashing 
provides a hood over the step flashing and is bent and inserted into a masonry cut groove in 
brick or block. Flashing a rock chimney after a roof tear off is near impossible to do properly 
because you can't cut a groove in rock to tuck in bent flashing. The cap flashing is then laid 
flush and caulked at top, often failing in a short period of time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;There is a product called Peel-n-Seal that is a foil backed sheet of tar and is pliable. It comes in 
a roll that can be cut with a knife and after peeling off wax paper can be molded to fit and seal 
against uneven surfaces like rock or stone. Some guys heat up the tar backing first with a 
butane torch for immediate sealing, depending on outside temperatures. This doesn't look as 
good as copper, but is a lot better than not installing proper cap or counter flashing. &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: In my own interpretation of the SOP, I do not think inspection for a vapor barrier is included. 
However, I decided to include it because I am unsure of what should be inferred from the SOP. If you 
want you can Delete it, or select it and the select the EDIT T button at the second toolbar above and 
UN-Exclude by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on dirt floor of basement or crawlspace?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2.. Foundation vents should have screens.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 
3.142857. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral 
ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and 
windows, and 25% through the floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floor spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vapor barrier is a roll of plastic (6 mil thick preferred) that is spread out over the crawlspace to keep 
moisture from entering the crawlspace from the ground. It is essential and inexpensive compared to its 
prevention abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The building inspector shall observe:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; 
Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the 
operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of 
any readily accessible thermostatic control. The building inspector shall describe: Insulation in 
unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The building 
inspector shall: Move insulation where readily visible evidence indicates the need to do so; and Move 
insulation where chimneys penetrate roofs, where plumbing drain/waste pipes penetrate floors, 
adjacent to earth filled stoops or porches, and at exterior doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The building inspector is not required to report on:&lt;/strong&gt; Concealed insulation and vapor retarders; or 
Venting equipment that is integral with household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>ATTIC INSULATION</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector should inspect: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The insulation in unfinished spaces. The ventilation of attic spaces. 
Mechanical ventilation systems. And report on the general absence or lack of insulation. 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Enter the attic or any unfinished spaces that are not readily 
accessible or where entry could cause damage or pose a safety hazard to the inspector in his 
or her opinion. Move, touch, or disturb insulation. Move, touch or disturb vapor retarders. 
Break or otherwise damage the surface finish or weather seal on or around access panels 
and covers. Identify the composition or exact R-value of insulation material. Activate 
thermostatically operated fans. Determine the types of materials used in insulation or 
wrapping of pipes, ducts, jackets, boilers, and wiring. Determine the adequacy of ventilation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 
3.142857. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral 
ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and 
windows, and 25% through the floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The building inspector shall observe:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; 
Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the 
operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation 
of any readily accessible thermostatic control. The building inspector shall describe: Insulation in 
unfinished spaces; and Absence of insulation in unfinished space at conditioned surfaces. The building

		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on exterior door trim /jambs at bottom ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. The "jerk and let go" test for the garage door works best but there is a risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt; Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>CHIMNEYS, FLUES AND VENTS (for fireplaces, gas water heaters or heat systems)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: In my own interpretation of the SOP, I do not think Ventilation is included or the protocol was left 
out as there is no mention of inspecting the ventilation of Heat System except in the 6.5.5 title 
&amp;quot;Heating and Ventilation.&amp;quot; It does state that Chimneys and Flues are not included. However, I decided 
to include it because I am unsure of what should be inferred from the SOP. If you want you can Delete 
it, or select it and the select the EDIT T button at the second toolbar above and UN-Exclude by 
default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is there any gas venting that exits building too close to the gas meter, a window or under a deck?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is the chimney leaning or are there signs of trim rework where the chimney contacts the wall of the 
building?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. When the gas furnace and gas water heater connect to one vent, the highest BTU unit needs to 
connect on the bottom.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. In most areas, the liners for wood burning stoves or fireplaces cannot share the liner with other fuel 
burning type units such as Gas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Unless you can clearly see all of the liner from end to end, use the auto-comment that the chimney 
liner was not inspected&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Examine the vent pipe that connects furnace to chimney for rust or white deposits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Usually 1/4 inch or more of creosote should tell you to recommend cleaning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A chimney fire can sometimes occur on clay liners with no consequence if water was not poured 
on it from the fire department. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Water can crack the liner. Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a fireplace that has 
had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the roof on the 
shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this 
rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it to determine if a chimney fire 
occurred and if this liner is safe to use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the insert to its liner. If not, 
creosote can collect on top of the insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can 
destroy a brick chimney - if not the building. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting 
the insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined. &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>( OIL FURNACES ) over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Meanwhile, check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). An irratic movement of damper lid and soot build-up should be noted. Furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition of furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. If it's not running normal, recommend a licensed heat contractor service and repair as needed. Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. ( GAS FURNACES ) use a gas tracer around unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. If flame dances sharply or rolls under burner recommend service. Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition when furnace comes&amp;quot;on.&amp;quot; Use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). If over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. When in doubt, recommend a licensed heat contractor to inspect further. ( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well should still be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. ( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 60 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. The fan outside should be moving. And grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. The coils inside air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. ( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. There should never be an outlet on wall directly above electric base. Remove front cover on baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&amp;#160;Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on exterior door trim /jambs 
at bottom (including sliding glass doors, patio doors, side lights etc.)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing 
(check all doors). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at 
the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom . &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for &amp;quot;daylight&amp;quot; and 
continuous weather-stripping. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper 
alignment and a tight fit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for &amp;quot;Cloudy&amp;quot; appearance or cracked glass. This is a 
good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door 
opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door 
reverses or not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely 
damage the door if you're not careful. The door can &amp;quot;fold-up&amp;quot; damaging the door panel and chain 
drive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. 
Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment 
screws can be tricky to adjust. &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>Look at an old building with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet).

Rust along bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heat elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU. See Discoveries and Auto Comments. Gas water heaters should be cranked up to come on and test draw at diverter with a match. If draw does not suck out flame on match, there could be a venting problem. White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in gas when not venting properly. A greasy residue on top of gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.</iiHelp>

&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible. These are 
walkable roofs and not too steep. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the roof. 
Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent 
pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Enter any crawlspaces that are not readily accessible or where entry could cause damage 
or pose a hazard to the inspector. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Move stored items or debris. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Operate sump pumps. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

bracing, joists, joist spans or support systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Perform or provide any engineering or architectural service. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Report on the adequacy of any structural system or component.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Check brick and mortar of the foundation at all downspout locations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Notice any new downspouts or splashblocks that may alert you to check for previous water 
intrusion once inside the basement or crawlspace.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on the dirt floor of the basement or crawlspace?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Note water stains on the inside wall of the crawlspace or basement as to whether or not they 
indicate current intrusion.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should be noted in your report. 
Whether or not you use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The 
word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be 
used in a inspection report.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the 
building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create 
a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. 
Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the footing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of 
water intrusion.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/strong&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are 
old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a building is built. Most of the 
time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack 
could mean a fresh crack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is usually the least significant. A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;vertical crack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a little more concerning but not 
as bad as a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the 
worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) 
and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the 
block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it. A 1/4 inch 
gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with 
hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer 
and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the 
likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. 
When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 
for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement 
and be sued for thousands. 
&lt;p&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find 
leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it 
appear to work properly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the 
sump pump. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each 
inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include 
new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed 
and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Inspect interiors of flues or chimneys, cleanouts, water softening or filtering systems, 
dishwashers, interceptors, separators, sump pumps, well pumps or tanks, safety or shut-of 
valves, whirlpools, swimming pools, floor drains, lawn sprinkler systems or fire sprinkler 
systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Determine the exact flow rate, volume, pressure, temperature, or adequacy of the water 
supply. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Verify or test anti-scald devices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G. Determine the water quality or potability or the reliability of the water supply or source. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H. Open sealed plumbing access panels. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Operate any main, branch or fixture valve. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K. Test shower pans, tub and shower surrounds or enclosures for leakage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L. Evaluate the compliance with local or state conservation or energy standards, or the 
proper design or sizing of any water, waste or venting components, fixtures or piping. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M. Determine the effectiveness of anti-siphon, back-flow prevention or drain-stop devices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N. Determine whether there are sufficient clean-outs for effective cleaning of drains. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O. Evaluate gas, liquid propane or oil storage tanks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. Inspect any private sewage waste disposal system or component within such a system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Inspect water treatment systems or water filters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R. Inspect water storage tanks, pressure pumps, ejector pumps, or bladder tanks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S. Evaluate wait time for hot water at fixtures, or perform testing of any kind on water heater 
elements. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T. Evaluate or determine the adequacy of combustion air. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U. Test, operate, open or close safety controls, manual stop valves and/or temperature or 
pressure relief valves. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

solar water heating or hot water circulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W. Determine the presence or condition of polybutylene plumbing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is the gas water heater 18&amp;quot; off the floor and mounted on a proper stand or support?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is the water heater strapped securely to the wall (required in earthquake zones)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. If the gas line to the water heater or furnace could be bumped or ruptured by a vehicle, a pole or 
guard post should be recommended&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. If the water heater is in the crawlspace or basement, it should not be lower than ground level. You 
may not dig a hole to set the water heater in.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Use a lighter at the draft hood when the gas water heater is on to check for proper draw.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. A gas water heater in the closet needs fresh air from the attic at the ceiling and near the floor.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of building) or possible leak at 
the liner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rust along the bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heating elements. 
Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel 
access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney 
under the smaller BTU. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test 
the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on 
a match, there could be a venting problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting 
properly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water 
heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the building has not had the 
water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The 
primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water. 
With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant 
building and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Be on alert for gas log starters and educate the buyer about the dangers of gas key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Remember that the match flame should be lit and at the pilot hole before you turn the gas valve 
when using a key. If not, you wont have any hair left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;My opinion on gas log starters comes from continuing ed and they are dangerous to the 
homeowner and to a child or teen. They also take awhile to burn solid wood and more creosote is 
created than with kiln.&lt;/li&gt;

		<iiText>DOORS (Interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. Check for holes in the door and for a doorstop. Note any trim missing, or hardware (check all doors). BASEMENT/CRAWLSPACE: Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water at all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter crawl space, look at each inside wall, left and right of entry, for water or mud marks on wall. If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and that it appears to work properly. Check to see if the door is delaminating on the bottom or deteriorated. SLIDING GLASS DOORS AND PATIO DOORS:  Open and close the door as needed and check for "Day light" and continuous weather-stripping. Also close the door with the knob until it latches. Then turn the deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. GARAGE DOORS: Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening. Document if the door reverses or not. If you use your hand to resist, and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if not careful. The door can "fold-up", damaging the door panel and chain drive. Even if the door has electronic sensors it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of the opener.</iiHelp>

To do this, use the cut-off switch at the furnace before you set the thermostat to turn the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for service and repair as needed.&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer.&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even.&lt;LI&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the burner recommend service.&lt;LI&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light. &lt;LI&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the chimney for integrity and proper seal.&lt;LI&gt; Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any).&lt;LI&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level.&lt;LI&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass.&lt;LI&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule.&lt;LI&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit.&lt;LI&gt; Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working.&lt;LI&gt;The fan outside should be moving. Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you have heat.&lt;LI&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat.&lt;LI&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service.&lt;LI&gt;The coils inside the air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant.&lt;LI&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly.&lt;LI&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees.

&lt;LI&gt;Make a note if the only connection for dryer is gas. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note if both are available, as a plus. 
&lt;LI&gt;Try to inspect the vent pipe for exhaust fans in the attic to see if they terminate outside.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Fireplaces: look for damaged or deteriorated fire brick on fire box walls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure ash dump on the floor of the firebox has a proper lid and a tight seal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure the damper works and whether or not it is easy to operate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Looking up into the fireplace, make sure you see no cavity between the finished wall and 
masonry. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;You should see no visible wood or framing. &lt;/li&gt;

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

1. Is the sump pump in a proper container?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Does the drain for the sump pump exit the building?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is there a proper GFCI outlet provided?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. The sump pump must not be using an extension cord or temporary wiring.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sump pumps work fine when all the water is removed and air dries out the crawlspace within 2-3 
days. If all the water is not removed, then the pump is not adequate and more corrective action 
is needed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;When recommending a sump pump be installed, you should think about trenches around the 
perimeter with gravel installed leading to the lowest area and a way to exit water from building 
without using the sewer system, so our taxpayer dollars don't treat the rain water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Think about electricity which usually requires an electrician to install a GFCI outlet within reach 
of the sump pump cord (no extension cords). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Don't forget the plastic vapor barrier. If all that makes sense then it may solve a water problem. 
Another problem to look for is an approved sump pump container, not a bucket. What's the 
difference? A lot of difference, if a water infiltration expert comes behind you slinging mud. A 
bucket with a few drain holes in the bottom should work - but I would reference in my report that 
the bucket while appears to work fine is not an approved sump pump container as some repair 
specialist may note. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Don't forget to raise the rod and float to see if it actually works. &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>Look at an old building with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Inspect or operate screens, storm windows, shutters, awnings, fences, outbuildings, or 
exterior accent lighting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Inspect items, including window and door flashings, which are not visible or readily

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Are there any lifted nails on the siding or loose, discolored soffit panels?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Are there any repairs to siding or soffits that is inconsistent?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on soffits, fascia, column 
bases, window sills, porch flooring or bottom of door jambs?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Do you notice any new paint peel or bubbling that indicates a leak has not been corrected at eaves 
or fascias?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. If it's raining during the inspection, it may be difficult to detect deterioration of the eaves and roof and 
you may need to note a &amp;quot;not inspected&amp;quot; for these areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Look for paint bubbles or wrinkles in paint, then poke and check them. Eaves or soffit panels 
can hide soft deterioration until poked or touched. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Clogged gutters in the past may have rotted soffits or eaves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;When dealing with exposed eaves, look for the starter or first run of roof board for deterioration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Dark painted wood on the second story can hide deterioration well. If its raining during your 
inspection and you have a second story eave painted dark it will be very difficult to spot 
deterioration (been there - done that). Check to see if vents are applicable or needed and intact. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Examine the dishwasher, drain line and run dishwasher through a cycle. If they're dirty dishes inside, add detergent (usually stored under the sink). Just make sure its detergent for dishwasher and not dishwashing detergent, or you'll be there for a while. Check all the movable parts and the heating element and support clips. Make sure the unit is securely mounted to countertop. Remember a leaky gasket could result in a new dishwasher, so always run through a cycle to check for leaks.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on dirt floor of basement or crawlspace?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.. Foundation vents should have screens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Floor spaces:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A vapor barrier is a roll of plastic (6 mil thick preferred) that is spread out over the crawlspace to keep moisture from entering the crawlspace from the ground. It is essential and inexpensive compared to its prevention abilities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiText>THE GUARDS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the guards. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Guards should be constructed to prevent adults from falling over them and prevent children from crawling 
through them. The height of a guard is measured vertically from the sloped plane adjoining the tread nosing or 
leading edge.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the guard strength. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The design strength of a guard should resist a 200-pound concentrated load applied at any point in any 
direction along the handrail or the top of the guard. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The design strength for a guard should resist a horizontal load of 0.5 kN/m or concentrated load of 1.0 kN 
applied inward or outward at any point at the top of the guard. The top of the guard should resist an evenly 
distributed vertical load of 1.5 kN/m. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Intermediate rails or balusters should be able to withstand a horizontal load of 50 pounds on an area equal 
to one square foot. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The guard should resist a horizontal load applied inward or outward on the elements within the guard, 
including solid panels and pickets, of 0.5 kN applied over a maximum width of 300 mm and a height of 300 mm 
imposed, engaging at least 3 balusters.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the height of the elevated floor level. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
All decks and porches, including those with insect screening, landings, balconies, mezzanines, galleries, ramps, 
or raised floor surfaces located more than 30 inches (US), 1.2 m (CA), above the floor or ground should have 
guards. A guard is necessary at those elevated floor areas, because a fall from that height can result in injury. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Where an interior stair has more than 2 risers, the sides of the stair and the landing or floor level around 
the stairwell should be protected by a guard on each side that is not protected by a wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the guard height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The minimum height of the horizontal guard should be 36 inches. Open sides of stairways with a total rise 
of more than 30 inches above the floor or ground should have guards not less than 34 inches in height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The minimum height for interior guards should be 900 mm high. Where the walking surface served by a 
guard is not more than 1,800 mm above the finished ground level, the minimum height of an exterior guard 
should be 900 mm high; otherwise, the minimum height for all exterior guards should be 1,070 mm high. The 
maximum height of a required guard at a landing should be no more than 1,070 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check for damage. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Inspect for cracked, loose or missing intermediate rails. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check for a ladder effect. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Guards should not have horizontal or ornamental patterns, members, attachments, or openings that 
will facilitate climbing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the glass in guards. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Glass used as a handrail assembly or a guard section should be constructed of either single fully tempered 
glass, laminated fully tempered glass, or laminated heat-strengthened glass. The minimal nominal thickness 
should be &amp;#188; inch. Each pane of safety glazing installed should be identified by a manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s designation, 
which should be acid etched, sand blasted, ceramic fired, laser etched, embossed, or of a type that once 
applied, cannot be removed without being destroyed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Glass in guards should be wired glass or safety glass of the laminated or tempered type.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(New building)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Did you fill sink basins full of water and drain simultaneously to check for leaks at 
the basket strainer or waster line connections?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sinks)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Is the waste line a P-trap? Is is vented? Are there shut-off valves under the sink?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Did you pull back insulation under the bathroom floors to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs 
using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that 
newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2&amp;quot; diameter waste line and new washing machines have 
stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, 
or the drain hose may have been modified in some way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic 
system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building 
safety department on this issue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could 
clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded. A repair would be to install a GFCI 
outlet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in 
between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who 
repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old 
pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.). They will 
sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a 
building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud 
inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized 
supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you 
would think. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector should inspect: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. Multiple gas meter installations, such as a building with multiple tenant spaces, and verify that 
each meter is clearly and permanently identified with the respective space supplied. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B. The heating systems using normal operating controls and describe the energy source and 
heating method. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C. And report as in need of repair heating systems which do not operate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D. And report if the heating systems are deemed inaccessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;E. And verify that a permanent means of access with permanent ladders and/or catwalks is 
present for equipment and appliances on roofs higher than 16 feet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;F. And verify the presence of level service platforms for appliances on roofs with a 25 percent 
slope or greater. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;G. And verify that a luminaire and receptacle outlet are provided at or near the appliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. And verify that the system piping appears to be sloped to permit the system to be drained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. For connectors, tubing and piping that might be installed in a way that exposes them to physical 
damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Wood framing for cutting, notching and boring that might cause a structural or safety issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Pipe penetrations in concrete and masonry building elements to verify that they are sleeved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Exposed gas piping for identification by a yellow label marked &amp;quot;Gas&amp;quot; in black letters occurring at 
intervals of 5 feet or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. And determine if any appliances or equipment with ignition sources are located in public, private, 
repair or parking garages or fuel-dispensing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N. And verify that fuel-fired appliances are not located in or obtain combustion air from sleeping rooms, 
bathrooms, storage closets or surgical rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O. For the presence of exhaust systems in occupied areas where there is a likelihood of excess heat, 
odors, fumes, spray, gas, noxious gases or smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. And verify that outdoor air intake openings are located at least 10 feet from any hazardous or 
noxious contaminant sources such as vents, chimneys, plumbing vents, streets, alleys, parking lots 
or loading docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Outdoor exhaust outlets for the likelihood that they may cause a public nuisance or fire hazard due 
to smoke, grease, gases, vapors or odors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. For the potential of flooding and evidence of past flooding that could cause mold in ductwork or 
plenums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S. Condensate drains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;II. The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Inspect or evaluate interiors of flues or chimneys, fire chambers, heat exchangers, 
humidifiers, dehumidifiers, electronic air filters, solar heating systems, fuel tanks, safety 
devices, pressure gauges, or control mechanisms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Determine the uniformity, temperature, flow, balance, distribution, size, capacity, BTU, or 
supply adequacy of the heating system. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Light or ignite pilot flames. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Activate heating, heat pump systems, or other heating systems when ambient 
temperatures or when other circumstances are not conducive to safe operation or may 
damage the equipment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Override electronic thermostats. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Evaluate fuel quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is the heat pump / condenser level?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Are the foam sleeves on the suction line intact?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Are bushes or a fence obstructing air flow?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Hydronic systems should have a water heater that is designed for heating the building and not use 
converted water heaters. Converted water heaters may not have a high enough BTU rating.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Are there any electric outlets located on the wall above the electric baseboard which could be a 
possible fire hazard?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Heating Equipment over 15 years old and still operating should still be noted as old, and 
recommend servicing them annually to monitor for safe operation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;(Oil furnaces) Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be 
leaking fumes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an 
existing test hole (if any). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;An erratic movement of the damper lid on the vent pipe and/or soot build-up should be noted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It's a good technique to observe the firing, or ignition, of the furnace. To do this, use the cut-off 
switch at the furnace before you set the thermostat to turn the furnace on. If it's not running 
normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for service and repair as needed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the unit. Examine burners and raceway for 
charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;If flame dances sharply or rolls under the burner recommend service. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some 
radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they 
heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for 
leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years 
old and operating well it should be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for 
safe operation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. 
Examine the vent pipe and where it enters the chimney for integrity and proper seal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in the vent pipe, or at an 
existing test hole (if any). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 65 degrees or less. You 
could damage the unit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out of the 
registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The fan outside should be moving. Just because the fan outside is moving doesn't mean you 
have heat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending 
service. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The coils inside the air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The ambient air test differential on a heat pump should be between 14 and 22 degrees. Use a 
thermometer at the main plenum and use one at the return air at the air handler. The difference 
in these (in AC mode) should be 14 to 22 degrees. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to 
wall or floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;There should never be an outlet on the wall directly above electric base. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Remove the front cover on the baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of the base 
located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal 
heating up of unit and can cause a fire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/strong&gt; permanently installed heating systems including: Heating 
equipment; Normal operating controls; Automatic safety controls; Chimneys, flues, and vents, where 
readily visible; Solid fuel heating devices; Heat distribution systems including fans, pumps, ducts and 
piping, with supports, insulation, air filters, registers, radiators, fan coil units, convectors; and the

Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a fireplace that has had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the roof on the shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the insert to its liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the building. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting the insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>SERVICE ENTRANCE AND PANELS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Circuit breaker brand should match the panel brand. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their own circuit brand only, or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS. WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company. Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard. General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label. When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on panel states that no other brand is allowed. The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in form of litigation. Whether they do or don 't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it. There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself. Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground. Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers wouldn't do it.</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;Unlock window, raise bottom sash fully, then lower to half open and 1/3 open, then close and lock. 
Note if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The window won't stay up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It is difficult to operate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check glass, screen, wood casing and trim. The window that you don't inspect is the one that is 
not working. (Murphy's law). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The window that has all the cute glass knick-knacks on it is the one that doesn't work. 
(Murphy's law). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Plastic or vinyl windows on a new building can sometimes be extremely difficult to lock. This is 
because either the window was not installed in the opening correctly (too tight or out of square) 
which can be a costly issue to correct if it involves removal and re-setting the window, or it is the 
window itself. According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be 
locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can 
be difficult to line up and lock. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for 
windows that were installed in too wide of an opening. Sometimes daylight can be seen (air 
infiltration) between the window and side jambs. This could involve a lot of work to correct. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It is important to tell the client where their main water shut off is and if there is not one, where it 
can be accessed easily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;If you don't find a main shutoff in the house, then see if the water meter outside and a &amp;quot;street

		<iiText>Handrail(s)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Determine if the stairway should have a handrail. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Any stairway of 4 or more risers should have a handrail on at least one side. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the handrail height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
The height of a handrail is measured vertically from the sloped plane adjoining the tread nosing or leading 
edge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The handrail height should be at least 34 inches and not more than 38 inches. (Exception: If there is a 
continuous handrail transition between flights, the handrail height at the transition can be greater than the 
maximum.) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The handrail height should be at least 800 mm, and not more than 965 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect continuity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
The handrail should be continuous for the full length of the flight of stairs, measured from a point directly 
above the top riser to a point directly above the bottom riser of the flight. Continuity can be interrupted by a 
newel post at a turn. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: A volute, starting easing, or turnout can be installed over the lowest tread. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: A doorway or landing can interrupt continuity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail termination. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Handrails should end at a newel post or a wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Handrails should terminate in a manner that will not obstruct travel or create a hazard. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail clearance. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Handrails adjacent to a wall should have a space of not less than 1 1&amp;frasl;2 inches between the wall and the 
handrails. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Handrails adjacent to a wall should have a space of not less than 50 mm between the wall and the 
handrails, or 60 mm if the surface behind the handrail is rough or abrasive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the handrail attachment to the wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The handrail should have attachment devices to transfer to the structural wall a concentrated load of 200 
pounds applied at any point in any direction. CA: The handrail should have attachment devices to transfer to 
the structural wall a concentrated load of CA: 0.9 kN applied at any point in any direction. The attachment 
points should not be spaced more than 1.2 m apart. The first attachment point should be no more than 300 mm 
from the end of the handrail. If attached to wooden structural components, the fasteners should consist of at 
least 2 wood screws at each point, penetrating at least 32 mm into solid wood.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then call the electrician and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn. Pass all panels that appear to be wired properly based on what is proper, and recommend an electrician on everything else.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value

&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value

To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>INSULATION UNDER FLOOR SYSTEM</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note Floor insulation is not spelled out in the InterNACHI Commercial SOP but the wording 
below taking from the &amp;quot; Attic Ventilation and Insulation&amp;quot; section suggest in general terms the 
unfinished spaces shall be inspected for insulation. You can Delete the item if you think it is not 
in the SOP or use it or Exclude it by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.5.10 The inspector should inspect: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The insulation in unfinished spaces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;he ventilation of attic 
spaces. Mechanical ventilation systems. And report on the general absence or lack of insulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Enter the attic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; or any unfinished spaces &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that are not readily 
accessible or where entry could cause damage or pose a safety hazard to the inspector in his 
or her opinion. Move, touch, or disturb insulation. Move, touch or disturb vapor retarders. 
Break or otherwise damage the surface finish or weather seal on or around access panels 
and covers. Identify the composition or exact R-value of insulation material. Activate 
thermostatically operated fans. Determine the types of materials used in insulation or 
wrapping of pipes, ducts, jackets, boilers, and wiring. Determine the adequacy of ventilation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 
3.142857. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral 
ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and 
windows, and 25% through the floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value &lt;/li&gt;

		<iiHelp>This question is good for miscellaneous plumbing items or components such as pressure reducing valves, broken plumbing, incorrect or problem in plumbing. Outside faucets. To inspect thoroughly, do the basement or crawlspace last. By testing the faucets and drains first (inside the house) will allow you to discover leaks underneath. Trace all plumbing lines and look at the floor or plastic on floor for water or stains etc. Now's a good time to check for a P trap on the washing machine drain line. Also the Dryer vent piping.</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is the meterbase secure on the wall?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is a drip loop present at weather head?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

3. Is the wall anchor in place?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Is there a bond wire that connects to the metal plumbing supply lines where supply enters building?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Is the Electrical panel missing screws?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Do the circuit breaker brands match the panel brand?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. If the Meterbase is not upgraded but the electrical panel is... Ok, unless the service wire from the 
meterbase to the panel is upgraded, then the meterbase should have been upgraded also.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Is the Meterbase grounded with wire, secure clamp and ground rod?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
9. The Main disconnect breaker should be on the outside panel if the inside panel is further than 5 feet 
from the meterbase.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
10. Are there any rusted screws or bus connectors in any panels?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
11. Are there any Knockout covers (blanks) missing?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
12. Are there any wiring missing romex connectors where wire enters into the panel?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
13. Are there any exposed wiring splices outside of the panel or on water heater?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
14. Is the panel secure to the wall? Is the Meterbase secure to the wall?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
15. Are any panels located too close to water? Hidden inside a cabinet? Not accessible?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A bond wire is a ground wire that grounds the panel to the metal plumbing that goes into the 
soil. A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some 
rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with 
no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but not new construction. The problem 
occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic 
or PVC, which removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make 
sure the electric panel is grounded. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Some electricians say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a 
ground. I have heard some electricians disagree and say that there is always a way to ground 
the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that &amp;quot;there is only 
one ground wire found on the panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed 
to non-metal and there is no ground&amp;quot;. Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get 
changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the panel. I recommend 
an electrician add another ground wire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrician may point this out to your buyer 
after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit 
properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void 
the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more 
breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix 
because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel 
label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part 
of SIEMENS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only 
their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on 
the label. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later it was found that the 
source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the 
insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have 
revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the panel states that no other brand is allowed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the form of litigation. 
Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This 
grounds the panel itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). 
But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing 
has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping 
that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the 
ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electricians. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<iiText>ROOF STRUCTURE AND ATTIC (If the attic is inaccessible, report the method used to inspect)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed something. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. Always note fire damage in the attic.  And do a stab test to determine the strength of a charred area. Sometimes the"Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend repairs. Sags can occur where a plywood clip is missing, you have a damaged truss or rafters spaced a little too far apart or you have a bad crown in wood. Or possibly a weak piece of plywood. Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4" rafter spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation and clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. To get the R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply thickness in inches by 3.142857. For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. Or better yet, use the"AUTO COMMENTS." Insulation usually comes in four Types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand, Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock, Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals. Rigid Foam Board (used on the exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) is obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.</iiHelp>

You may not dig a hole to set the water heater in.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Use a lighter at the draft hood when the gas water heater is on to check for proper draw.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6.  A gas water heater in the closet needs fresh air from the attic at the ceiling and near the floor.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing.&lt;LI&gt;Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of building) or possible leak at the liner.&lt;LI&gt;Rust along the bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heating elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the building has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant building and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Are there bushes against the siding?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is the siding in contact with the ground or mulch?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Check the siding at planter boxes, stacked wood and downspout locations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Is siding deteriorated where the the deck attaches to building (above deck)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Are there any lifted nails, discolored or loose siding?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Are there any repairs to siding or soffits that is inconsistent?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on soffits, fascia, column 
bases, window sills, porch flooring or bottom of door jambs?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Do you see where the dryer vent terminates outside?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle the building slowly, paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for 
loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along the top of garage 
door and window brick mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green algae areas&lt;br /&gt;
should be noted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Problem areas to look for are where roof stops at chimney wall (roof junction) or where the end of 
the gutter butts against another wall of the building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Look for siding in contact with ground. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Look under windows, at dormers and above deck at starter row. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<iiHelp>Central Air should not be ran if outside temperature is at 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Turn on A/C and wait about 15 minutes or so. Grab and hold the suction line just before it enters air handler inside and feel for ice cold. (This will tell you if the compressor outside is making cold air). No cold feeling could mean  a number of things that will involve servicing the unit (low on refrigerant, leak, compressor problem etc.) Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. Recommend service. If the suction line is iced over where it enters Air Handler, the coils inside air handler may need cleaning. To check for ambient air, you would need the A/C to run longer than 15 minutes or so. Insert a thermometer in the supply plenum, and then insert another thermometer into the return-air plenum. The Return air should be within 20-25 degrees of the thermometer in the supply plenum. The amount of time the A/C would need to run before checking ambient air will vary, depending upon how hot it is inside when you first ran the A/C. This may require an hour or so to give the A/C a chance to work at it's potential.</iiHelp>

If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

		<iiText>Risers and Treads</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the riser height. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The minimum riser height is 4 inches, and the maximum is 7 3&amp;frasl;4 inches. For spiral stairs, the maximum rise is 
9 1&amp;frasl;2 inches. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The minimum riser height riser height is 125 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm. For curved or spiral stairs, the 
rise should be between 125 mm and 180 mm. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the difference between the riser heights. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The greatest riser height within any flight of stairs should not exceed the smallest by more than 3/8 of an 
inch. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The greatest riser height within any flight of stairs should not exceed the smallest by more than 6 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the tread depth. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The minimum tread depth is 10 inches. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The minimum tread depth is 235 mm, and the maximum tread depth is 355 mm. The minimum run is 210 mm, 
and the maximum is 355 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the difference between the tread depths. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The greatest tread depth within any flight of stairs should not exceed the smallest by more than 3/8 of an 
inch. For winders, this is measured at the 12 inch walk line. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The greatest tread depth within any flight of stairs should not exceed the smallest by more than 6 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the spiral stair treads. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: For spiral stairs, all treads should be identical. Each tread should have at least a 7 1&amp;frasl;2 inch tread depth at 12 
inches from the narrower edge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: For spiral stairs, all treads should have minimum run not less than 150 mm, and an average run not less 
than 200 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the winder stair treads. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: For winder stairs, treads should have a depth of at least 10 inches measured at a point 12 inches from the 
side where the treads are narrowest. Winder treads should have a depth of at least 6 inches at any point. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Where angled treads or winders are incorporated into a stair, the treads in sets of angled treads or winders 
within a flight should turn in the same direction. A set of winders should not turn through more than 90 
degrees. Winder-type turns in stairs are limited to 30 or 45 degrees only. The run should be at least 280 mm 
measured 230 mm away from the handrail at the narrow end of the tread.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the slope. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The walking surface of the stairway treads and landings should be sloped no steeper than 1&amp;frasl;4-inch vertical 
in 12 inches horizontal (a 2% slope). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The cross-slope of treads and landings should not exceed 1 in 100 (a 1% slope).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the loads. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The minimum concentrated load on stair treads (on an area of 4 square inches) is 300 pounds. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The load on the stair should be designed for strength and rigidity under uniform loading criteria to support 
1.9 kPa for stairs serving a dwelling unit. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Check for cracked, damaged or loose treads.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is the deck properly bolted to the outer band of the building? Are deck joists supported by a ledger 
strip or hangers?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Check the picket or baluster spacing on the deck and hand/guard rail.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is siding deteriorated where the deck attaches to the building (above deck)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on soffits, fascia, column 
bases, window sills, porch flooring or bottom of door jambs?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Is there any underpinning of porches or areas that you could not see under?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Deck floor covered with outdoor carpet may have underlayment not approved for outdoor use. Decks 
with awning covers underneath deck to provide a roof may trap water, moisture and cause deterioration 
that is not accessible to verify.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Inspect slowly paying attention to ceiling, walls, floors and supports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Inspect column(s) 360 degrees for deterioration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Move away any bush or brush that may be hiding trapped moisture. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Newly painted areas on wood should be checked with finger pressure at suspicious areas. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check to see if rails are secure. 4 x 4 support posts should not be supporting more than 8 feet 
high. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Joists should be supported by a ledger or joist hangers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It is important to see if band of deck is bolted to band of building. If there is siding or wood 
underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the 
house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make 
sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band 
to building is to use 5/8&amp;quot; galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches 
or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the building to screw the nuts, 
then 5/8&amp;quot; galvanized lag screws are better than nothing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is the oil barrel stand leaning or weak? Are there stains on the ground from oil drips?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Are the oil or gas fuel lines damaged or kinked?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Does the Gas Dryer have a shut-off valve above the floor?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. The Natural Gas line &lt;strong&gt;should not&lt;/strong&gt; be soft copper until it comes through the floor or walls&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always tell the client when you discover an oil barrel in the ground. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always tell them that you did not test the soil for possible contamination or if the oil barrel is 
leaking or not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always make sure that gas piping has a cap on any unused end. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Soft copper piping for gas is not allowed in my area unless it is propane. This is when the piping 
travels through floors or walls etc. and can only change to soft piping like copper above the floor.

		<iiHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector should inspect:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. The basement. 
&lt;p&gt;B. The foundation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. The crawlspace&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D. The visible structural components. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. And report on the location of under-floor access openings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. And report any present conditions or clear indications of active water penetration observed by the 
inspector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. For wood in contact or near soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. And report any general indications of foundation movement that are observed by the inspector, such 
as but not limited to sheetrock cracks, brick cracks, out-of-square door frames or floor slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I. And report on any cutting, notching and boring of framing members which may present a 
structural or safety concern.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Enter any crawlspaces that are not readily accessible or where entry could cause damage 
or pose a hazard to the inspector. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Move stored items or debris. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Operate sump pumps. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Identify size, spacing, span, location or determine adequacy of foundation bolting, 
bracing, joists, joist spans or support systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Perform or provide any engineering or architectural service. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Report on the adequacy of any structural system or component.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Use the auto comment when ceiling is not visible which is almost always:&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Auto Comment:&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the walls and ceilings in the finished basement are covered and structural members are not 
visible. No obvious problems discovered. I could not see behind these coverings.&lt;/p&gt;

Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11. Are the tub faucets or shower arm loose in the wall when tugged on?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;12. Are the hot and cold faucets reversed?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;13. Are any bathtubs missing a shower?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints?  Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the building. Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Is the deck properly bolted to the outer band of the building? Are deck joists supported by a ledger 
strip or hangers?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Check the picket or baluster spacing on the deck and hand/guard rail.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is siding deteriorated where the deck attaches to the building (above deck)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on soffits, fascia, column 
bases, window sills, porch flooring or bottom of door jambs?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Is there any underpinning of porches or areas that you could not see under?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Deck floor covered with outdoor carpet may have underlayment not approved for outdoor use. Decks 
with awning covers underneath deck to provide a roof may trap water, moisture and cause deterioration 
that is not accessible to verify.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Inspect slowly paying attention to ceiling, walls, floors and supports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Inspect column(s) 360 degrees for deterioration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Move away any bush or brush that may be hiding trapped moisture. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Newly painted areas on wood should be checked with finger pressure at suspicious areas. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check to see if rails are secure. 4 x 4 support posts should not be supporting more than 8 feet 
high. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Joists should be supported by a ledger or joist hangers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;It is important to see if band of deck is bolted to band of building. If there is siding or wood 
underlayment in between the deck and house band, the bolts may not be into the meat of the 
house band enough. Make sure the support posts are notched to receive the band. If not, make 
sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band 
to building is to use 5/8&amp;quot; galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches 
or so in between. When you cannot access the inside band of the building to screw the nuts, 
then 5/8&amp;quot; galvanized lag screws are better than nothing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Inspect the interior of chimneys or flues, fire doors or screens, seals or gaskets, or mantels. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Determine the need for a chimney sweep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Operate gas fireplace inserts. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G. Inspect combustion and/or make-up air devices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H. Inspect heat distribution assists whether gravity controlled or fan assisted. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Ignite or extinguish fires. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Determine draft characteristics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K. Move fireplace inserts, stoves, or firebox contents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L. Determine adequacy of draft, perform a smoke test or dismantle or remove any fireplace 
component.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M. Perform an NFPA inspection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Note if the log starter is being improperly used with firelogs (no safety features).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Fireplaces: look for damaged or deteriorated fire brick on fire box walls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure ash dump on the floor of the firebox has a proper lid and a tight seal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure the damper works and whether or not it is easy to operate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Looking up into the fireplace, make sure you see no cavity between the finished wall and 
masonry. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;You should see no visible wood or framing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Be on alert for gas log starters and educate the buyer about the dangers of gas key. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Remember that the match flame should be lit and at the pilot hole before you turn the gas valve

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;My opinion on gas log starters comes from continuing ed and they are dangerous to the

&lt;p&gt;H. Verify that exhaust ducts do not appear to pass through fire walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. Try to verify that exhaust ducts lead directly to the exterior of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Try to verify that exterior exhaust outlets do not discharge walkways or create a nuisance in the 
opinion of the inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Inspect to determine that a portable fire extinguisher exists within a 30 foot travel distance of 
commercial-type cooking equipment that uses cooking oil or animal fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Inspect to determine that manual actuation devices for commercial cooking appliances exist near 
the means of egress from the cooking area, 42-48 inches above the floor, 10-20 feet away, and clearly 
identifying the hazards protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.Look for an undercut foundation where someone has dug below the original footing to create a 
basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also 
look for support piers where dirt was dug away around footing.&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Screw jacks used as a permanent support might work, but some inspectors will consider them as 
&amp;quot;for temporary use only&amp;quot; and will recommend replacement (FYI).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Older buildings)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Is the main girder supported every 8 feet or at seams?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule there should be a proper support and a proper footing under all girders at each end, 
and in between about every 6 feet or so. Older buildings were sometimes spaced about 8 feet. The 
floor joist should have a proper support at each end. If there are some homemade supports in the 
middle of some joists, (usually found in older buildings), you need to consider why they are there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Is there something heavy above the floor like a piano or heavy furniture? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Are the floor joists undersized or is the span too far and beginning to sag? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Is there a bounce in the floor above? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floor joists are not supposed to need any support between the two ends. Theoretically, you should be 
able to remove those temporary supports. Ask yourself if you would? Or what problem would result? 
That's how I determine if these temporary supports are really needed. If they are, then they need to 
have a proper support and footing. Usually a properly installed drop girder that supports several joists 
at one time is recommended. If I think they are not serving much purpose, I'll note that the temporary 
supports do not appear to be serving any real support need for the joist.&lt;/p&gt;

		<iiText>The Guards</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the guards. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Guards should be constructed to prevent adults from falling over them and prevent children from crawling 
through them. The height of a guard is measured vertically from the sloped plane adjoining the tread nosing or 
leading edge.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check the guard strength. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The design strength of a guard should resist a 200-pound concentrated load applied at any point in any 
direction along the handrail or the top of the guard. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The design strength for a guard should resist a horizontal load of 0.5 kN/m or concentrated load of 1.0 kN 
applied inward or outward at any point at the top of the guard. The top of the guard should resist an evenly 
distributed vertical load of 1.5 kN/m. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Intermediate rails or balusters should be able to withstand a horizontal load of 50 pounds on an area equal 
to one square foot. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The guard should resist a horizontal load applied inward or outward on the elements within the guard, 
including solid panels and pickets, of 0.5 kN applied over a maximum width of 300 mm and a height of 300 mm 
imposed, engaging at least 3 balusters.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the height of the elevated floor level. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
All decks and porches, including those with insect screening, landings, balconies, mezzanines, galleries, ramps, 
or raised floor surfaces located more than 30 inches (US), 1.2 m (CA), above the floor or ground should have 
guards. A guard is necessary at those elevated floor areas, because a fall from that height can result in injury. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Where an interior stair has more than 2 risers, the sides of the stair and the landing or floor level around 
the stairwell should be protected by a guard on each side that is not protected by a wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Measure the guard height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: The minimum height of the horizontal guard should be 36 inches. Open sides of stairways with a total rise 
of more than 30 inches above the floor or ground should have guards not less than 34 inches in height. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: The minimum height for interior guards should be 900 mm high. Where the walking surface served by a 
guard is not more than 1,800 mm above the finished ground level, the minimum height of an exterior guard 
should be 900 mm high; otherwise, the minimum height for all exterior guards should be 1,070 mm high. The 
maximum height of a required guard at a landing should be no more than 1,070 mm.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check for damage. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Inspect for cracked, loose or missing intermediate rails. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Check for a ladder effect. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US and CA: Guards should not have horizontal or ornamental patterns, members, attachments, or openings that 
will facilitate climbing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
Inspect the glass in guards. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
US: Glass used as a handrail assembly or a guard section should be constructed of either single fully tempered 
glass, laminated fully tempered glass, or laminated heat-strengthened glass. The minimal nominal thickness 
should be &amp;#188; inch. Each pane of safety glazing installed should be identified by a manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s designation, 
which should be acid etched, sand blasted, ceramic fired, laser etched, embossed, or of a type that once 
applied, cannot be removed without being destroyed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;
CA: Glass in guards should be wired glass or safety glass of the laminated or tempered type.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax).

Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should be noted in your report. Whether or not you use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7.

Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a building is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Also inspect all ductwork accessible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Note if the ductwork is not insulated, if there is AC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Many times the tape is failing and the ductpipe has pulled loose from the register underneath the 
floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Pull out or examine the filter as part of your air handler inspection. Many times the filter is the 
wrong size or clogged beyond belief. A clogged filter can cause $10 a month in electricity cost 
and shorten the life of the unit, not to mention poor air quality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;New construction: Make sure you try to look deep inside the return air cavity in the wall to look 
for unhealthy items left behind by sub contractors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Radiators for old boilers can clog or not heat fully. Sometimes they can be blown clean by a 
boiler technician and sometimes they cannot. One radiator could cost $1000 or more easily ($80 
a rung so I've heard) so be sure and write up any that do not get hot on both ends as needing 
servicing or further inspection by a Boiler technician. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roof&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. The inspector should inspect from ground level, or eaves or roof top (if a roof top access 
door exists):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The roof covering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. For presence of exposed membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Slopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. For evidence of significant ponding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. The gutters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. The downspouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;G. The vents, flashings, skylights, chimney and other roof penetrations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. The general structure of the roof from the readily accessible panels, doors or stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&amp;#160; For the need for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;II. The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Walk on any pitched roof surface. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Predict service life expectancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Inspect underground downspout diverter drainage pipes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Remove snow, ice, debris or other conditions that prohibit the observation of the roof 
surfaces. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Move insulation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Inspect antennae, lightning arresters, de-icing equipment or similar attachments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G. Walk on any roof areas that appear, in the opinion of the inspector, to be unsafe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H. Walk on any roof areas if it might, in the opinion of the inspector, cause damage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Perform a water test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Warrant or certify the roof. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K. Walk on any roofs that lack rooftop access doors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;InterNACHI Commercial SOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Does the vent pipe boot/flange on roof fit snug around the pipe?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Inspect the chimney above the roofline for spalling, cracks, missing mortar or missing rain cap.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Inspect the chimney crown and note any cracked or missing mortar, or improper caulking or 
silicone in cracks that may fail.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Do ridge vents have end caps and nail heads caulked? Are passive vents flashed properly? Do 
turbines turn freely?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Does the skylight have a flash kit or was it homemade? Are there repair/caulk signs? Cloudy 
appearance?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Is chimney leaning or are there signs of trim rework where chimney contacts the wall of building?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Skylights without manufactured flash kits can leak a lot easier than properly installed flash kits. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Skylights can go for years with no problems and leak only after time has passed and for no 
apparent reason noticed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Skylights can leak on one rainy day and not leak on another. It is impossible to look at a 
skylight installation and know if it will leak or not. Even when it looks perfect. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Homes that have had a pressure washing company spray onto skylights can blow away, or push 
sealant caulking away, and cause leaks. You can't know what has happened since the skylight 
has been installed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Look for fresh paint inside at the skylight chase or tell-tale water marks that may only be 
condensation and not leaks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Vaulted ceilings with skylights can cause condensation in summer, if the ceiling air gets hot 
enough and an AC vent is mixing with hot ceiling air. Water droplets (or stains) can form on the 
ceiling. Sometimes it is difficult to determine which one is occurring in the building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Chimneys: Look for loose mortar above the roof line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Check the cement crown for cracks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;White efflorescence or flaking of brick (spalling) indicates moisture is soaking into the brick 
somewhere. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Do not try to remove metal hood bonnets on chimney to inspect liner. They sometimes are 
difficult to get back on or have been semi-permanently glued requiring a lot of work each time it 
is removed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Wood siding chimneys can deteriorate if metal hood does not completely cover outside corner 
boards. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Stucco peeling away from the surface it is bonded to, is generally caused from moisture or a 
previously painted sub surface (painted masonry block that stucco is applied on). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Brick divider walls separating flues are still found on many old homes. Loose or missing brick in 
these divider walls calls for a certified chimney sweep to inspect further. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Roof penetrations: Know how to flash a chimney, install a vent pipe or vent fan hood flange into 
the weave of shingles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should be noted in your report. Whether or not you use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7.

Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a building is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

		<iiHelp>&lt;strong&gt;The inspector should inspect:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Multiple air conditioning compressor installations, such as a building with multiple tenant spaces, 
and verify that each compressor is clearly and permanently identified with the respective space 
supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. The central cooling equipment using normal operating controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. And verify that a luminaire and receptacle outlet are provided at or near the appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. And verify that a permanent means of access with permanent ladders and/or catwalks is present for 
equipment and appliances on roofs higher than 16 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. And verify the presence of level service platforms for appliances on roofs with a 25 percent slope or 
greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;F. Wood framing for cutting, notching and boring that might cause a structural or safety issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;G. Pipe penetrations in concrete and masonry building elements to verify that they are 
sleeved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;H. Piping support.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I. For connectors, tubing and piping that might be installed in a way that exposes them to 
physical damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;J. For the potential of flooding and evidence of past flooding that could cause mold in 
ductwork or plenums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;K. Condensate drains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The inspector is not required to:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Inspect or test compressors, condensers, vessels, evaporators, safety devices, pressure 
gauges, or control mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Determine the uniformity, temperature, flow, balance, distribution, size, capacity, BTU, or 
supply adequacy of the cooling system. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Inspect window units, through-wall units, or electronic air filters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Operate equipment or systems if exterior temperature is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit or 
when other circumstances are not conducive to safe operation or may damage the 
equipment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Inspect or determine thermostat calibration, heat anticipation or automatic setbacks or 
clocks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Examine electrical current, coolant fluids or gases, or coolant leakage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F.&amp;#160; Inspect tenant owned or maintained cooling equipment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G. Test for mold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Inspect the filter condition and look for a poor seal around the filter door or compartment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is there damaged or loose ductwork, duct tape?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Does the furnace or airhandler shut off when the blower door is removed (safety switch)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Note any possible asbestos on old boilers, radiator piping or vent pipe to chimney (older homes). 
Sometimes asbestos can be found on the underside of decorative radiator covers inside building.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Make sure you note if a room does not have a register or vent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Also inspect all ductwork accessible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Note if the ductwork is not insulated, if there is AC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Many times the tape is failing and the ductpipe has pulled loose from the register underneath the 
floor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Pull out or examine the filter as part of your air handler inspection. Many times the filter is the 
wrong size or clogged beyond belief. A clogged filter can cause $10 a month in electricity cost 
and shorten the life of the unit, not to mention poor air quality. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;New construction: Make sure you try to look deep inside the return air cavity in the wall to look 
for unhealthy items left behind by sub contractors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Radiators for old boilers can clog or not heat fully. Sometimes they can be blown clean by a 
boiler technician and sometimes they cannot. One radiator could cost $1000 or more easily ($80 
a rung so I've heard) so be sure and write up any that do not get hot on both ends as needing 
servicing or further inspection by a Boiler technician. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Read the auto-comments in the heat section. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Did you pull back insulation under the bathroom floors to check for leaks or deterioration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Did you tug on the hose bib(s) and test them for operation?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Did you write in the report that you did not remove garden hose to check for a drip?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Does the spray nozzle leak or drip above or below the sink when faucet is turned on? Is the aerator 
working?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Does the plumbing system pass the functional flow test? (Run a shower at bathing temperature and 
then turn on the sink faucets and flush the toilet. If you can still take a shower, it passes).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Toilets)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Does the toilet tank lid fit properly?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Does the tank have condensation leaking onto the floor?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Is the toilet loose at the floor connection? Are there leak signs?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Was the vinyl floor cut around the toilet?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
9. Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
10. Lift the toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to 
clean or hide iron problems before the inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the toilet tank&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
11. Are the tub faucets or shower arm loose in the wall when tugged on?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
12. Are the hot and cold faucets reversed?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
13. Are any bathtubs missing a shower?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
14. Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints? Are they supported ok?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
17. Indicate whether or not the jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your inspection on the type of water supply or 
distribution materials in the building. Sometimes there are several in one building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not 
&amp;quot;if&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. 
Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court 
for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVCcausing significant damage. Instead of 
a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the 
exposed piping that froze. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot. I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all 
fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take 
a picture. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<iiHelp>Look at an old building with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
1. Note any stains around chimney or vent pipes in attic. Is there mold or moisture present?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Is there any loose wiring in the attic?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
3. Is there any knob and tube wiring in the attic? They should not be covered with insulation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
4. Are the bath and range exhaust fans venting to the outside air?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
5. Is there a whole house fan or a thermostatically controlled fan in attic?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
6. Is there an air handler in attic? Filter? Drip pan? Float switch obstructed in drip pan?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
7. Is insulation installed right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
8. Are pull-down stairs to the attic mounted properly to ceiling joists at hinge points? Are nuts tight at 
each step?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
9. Does attic access fit the opening or seal opening properly?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
10. Note the absence (or condition) of firewall separation in attic when building is multi-family.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
11. Are plywood clips missing between sheets of plywood (if sags are apparent)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
12. Is there any loose wiring or exposed splices at the whole house fan?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
13. Note any catch pans or containers in the attic that may indicate periodic leaks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
14. Note if rafters are 2 x 4 but not truss construction. Usually found in some older homes and can 
allow sagging of roof.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-bottom: 0mm; list-style-type: disk; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The 
area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good 
flashlight and a back up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always note fire damage in the att&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;
i&lt;/font&gt;c. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes 
the &amp;quot;Char&amp;quot; is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, 
then recommend an engineer and repairs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sags can occur where: 
&lt;ul style="margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 0mm; list-style-type: circle; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;a plywood clip is missing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;a truss is damaged, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;rafters are spaced too far apart, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;you have a weak piece of plywood. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Undersized wood such as a &amp;quot;2 x 4 rafter&amp;quot; spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or 
reinforcement would be suggested. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also 
scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around 
recessed &amp;quot;can&amp;quot; lights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or from current. 
indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps being 
missing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<iiText>POLARITY AND GROUNDING OF RECEPTACLES WITHIN 6 FEET OF INTERIOR PLUMBING FIXTURES, AND ALL RECEPTACLES IN GARAGE, CARPORT,  EXTERIOR WALLS OF INSPECTED STRUCTURE</iiText>

Do you notice any GFCI outlets with freezers plugged into them? Don't forget to reset GFCI. Two prong plugs in the Garage or around any areas with water?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.  &lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

1. Note any old downspout drain tile/ piping that may no longer work properly or downspouts that need 
drainlines or splashblocks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
2. Look for where gutters are draining to and if there is standing water in the vicinity. Are there gutter 
screens installed? Are there leak signs at the gutter seams?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Be sure and comment on any negative slope towards building that may cause problems like 
erosion, water intrusion and silt travel. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Recommend landscaping or ground cover, vegetation or a retaining wall. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sometimes a swale, trench or burm created between a dirt bank and the house (or above dirt 
bank) may help in diverting water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Sometimes a loose or sagging gutter is because long gutter nails have splintered through fascia 
and missed the rafter tail, or the rafter tail or fascia is deteriorated. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;I have recommended in a report that &amp;quot;gutters are loose and needs securing&amp;quot; only to get a call 
back saying that the rafter tails were deteriorated. While it is impossible for the inspector to 
check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the 
possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as 
some nails need replacing. &lt;/li&gt;

What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. The "jerk and let go" test for the garage door works best but there is a risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8.

Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors).&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion.&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom .&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping.&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit.&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration.&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not.&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive.&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener.

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

&lt;ol style="margin-bottom: 0mm; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is 
grounded, and if the polarity is correct. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not &amp;quot;trip&amp;quot; the outlet if it is a non-grounded 
GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and 
attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Or, replace the three-prong &lt;em&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/em&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should 
be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;You can &amp;quot;trip&amp;quot; a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the 
short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe 
(that eventually contacts the soil). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being 
tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and 
strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights &amp;quot;Faint or Dim&amp;quot; and you 
press the button on the plug and it shows &amp;quot;Reverse polarity&amp;quot;, it may just be a &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; ground 
wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it &amp;quot;trips,&amp;quot; 
doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI 
Circuit. When you're inspecting the building don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be 
buying the homeowners spoiled food. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Are there leak signs?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Was the vinyl floor cut around the toilet?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints?  Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the building. Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Note any temporary repairs to waste lines which include caulking, putty, or homeowner repairs using clamps or flexible piping.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.
