threatening until repaired.

according to pressure changes under these worse case test conditions. Note that adding new fans 
or more fans in the home, remodeling or changes to the duct piping or new appliances or different 
fuel appliances could have an adverse effect on the CAZ and should be tested if any of these 
changes occur in the future</stVal>
		<stVal>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;failed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and creates an immediate hazard and need for concern. The scenario that caused the air 
pressure to go negative pass the limit creating an unsafe condition for the occupants was the 
*CAZ-factors*. Solutions could be to either add a fresh air supply kit to the CAZ (when practical), 
or convert the open combustible appliances to a &amp;quot;Sealed Combustion.&amp;quot; This means that the 
sealed combustion appliance will get the air it needs from the outside and it's exhaust is 
powered out rather than by natural draft. There may be other alternatives as well. At any case 
repairs are needed and should be addressed now as given certain scenarios toxic fumes can 
back draft and enter the room (while awake or sleeping)</stVal>

		<comText>Homes with appliances that burn fuel (fireplaces, gas water heaters, furnaces etc.) can easily backdraft and could pose a health and life threatening risk to the occupants in certain common scenarios. Sometimes simply by turning on a whole house fan or the combination of bath exhaust fans, the air handler, clothes dryer, can create negative pressure in the room of these appliances and cause the toxic flue gas to be pulled down the flue pipe and spill into the room. This can pose a life threatening situation and should be taken seriously.&amp;#160; Even wood burning fireplaces that back up smoke into a room sometimes is not because of the &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; of the fireplace as many point to, but instead could be from a nearby kitchen range hood creating negative pressure. Or, other appliances that come on in the home that has a fan (exhaust fans, dryer, air handler, leaky ducts that create pressure imbalances etc.). A CAZ test or &amp;quot;Combustion Appliance Zone&amp;quot; test involves a technical process where the BPI certified Building Analyst conducts a &amp;quot;worse case depressurization&amp;quot; test trying to make the combustion appliance venting fail measuring with a manometer, combustion analyzer and standards of testing. This test should be performed on any home with the above conditions for the well being of the occupant, and MUST be performed before and after any Air Sealing. A report with the results of your CAZ Test will be presented to you should you authorize this test to be conducted.</comText>

		<comText>Clothes Dryers can cost approximately 40 cents a load with gas dryers typically saving about 6 cents over an electric dryer. Add the cost of the washing machine and you can see that washing and drying the clothes can add up. This is based on a 45 minute drying period. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#003300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Tip: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When replacing a dryer make sure it has a &amp;quot;Moisture Sensor&amp;quot; that can help detect when the moisture is gone. It will also help prevent over-drying causing more ironing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Front end washing machines remove more water from the clothes which help the dryer finish faster.&lt;br /&gt;3. Clean the lint filter before each load (allows the moisture to leave the dryer quicker than a dirty filter).&lt;br /&gt;4. Ask your power company about demand or peak times and wash and dry your clothes to avoid the higher charge per kWh.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you over dry your clothes and they are wrinkled you can add a wet towel and dry some more to remove the wrinkles.&lt;/font&gt;</comText>

		<comText>The insulation and ventilation of the home was inspected and reported on with the above information. While the inspector makes every effort to find all areas of concern, some areas can go unnoticed. Venting of exhaust fans or clothes dryer cannot be fully inspected and bends or obstructions can occur without being accessible or visible (behind wall and ceiling coverings). Only insulation that is visible was inspected. Please be aware that the inspector has your best interest in mind. Any repair items mentioned in this report should be considered before purchase. It is recommended that qualified contractors be used in your further inspection or repair issues as it relates to the comments in this inspection report.</comText>

		<comName>std wh used as hydro</comName>
		<comText>Your water heater serves not only to provide domestic hot water (i.e. bathing, dishes, cooking etc.) but also provides the heat for the home (Hydronic). Hydronic water heaters have a higher BTU or ability to heat water hotter than a"Standard" water heater. However your water heater is a "Standard" water heater modified to also heat your home. This means that some Heating Contractors or Public Service Gas companies may differ on opinion as to whether or not this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the home. Because this Standard water heater has been in place for sometime, one can infer that if it was not adequately heating the home, the previous owners more than likely would have replaced it with a "Hydronic" water heater. I am unable to determine if this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the home and recommend you obtain a second opinion.</comText>

		<comName>Freezer</comName>
		<comText>Freezers for most homes are second in energy usage (after a refrigerator) or 3rd after a water heater and in terms of practicality if you can change your lifestyle to eliminate a freezer then you can save money. Depending upon the age and size of your freezer the energy cost to maintain one can vary on how much you open the door and what temperature it is stored. If your freezer is in the garage and its unheated the winter is going to be cheaper than in the garage in the summer and is opened more frequently. Freezers less than say 7 years old may be from $4- $8 a month and may negate the savings you might have experienced at the grocery store by getting an extra item or using those coupons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#003300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Tip:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Store less by trying to keep all your frozen food in the one refrigerator. It may be cost effective in the long run to purchase one large refrigerator that has ample freezer storage than to maintain a refrigerator and a freezer.&lt;/font&gt;</comText>

		<comText>Should your home's CAZ (Combustion Appliance Zone) fail you must correct this problem immediately for health and safety. Appliances that fail may be corrected by bringing in a fresh air source within the CAZ, removing large fans in the home (if this is the cause and depending upon the measurement readings and whether or not the fans causing the problem can be replaced with smaller CFM fans) or if the appliances are old replacing them with a &amp;quot;Sealed Combustion&amp;quot; and positive venting appliance that does not rely on the air in the CAZ. Many HVAC contractors are not trained to conduct a CAZ test and this test should only be conducted by a BPI certified Building Analyst. Note: Additions to the home, remodeling and adding fans (or large kitchen fans) can potentially change the CAZ from what was once safe to unsafe. If today's test results were safe, we recommend conducting another CAZ should any of these changes occur.&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="100%" align="center" style="border-collapse: collapse;

		<comText>Clay liners that once were used with oil furnaces, and are now being used for venting gas or propane furnaces or water heaters may deteriorate called "Spalling."

It also is not possible in some cases to inspect attic areas where a duplex unit exist and the buyer is purchasing the lower unit, or vice versa. Our company makes no representation as to the condition of these areas that were not inspected.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</comText>

		<comText>This home is considered a "fixer upper." The home inspection is limited to what can be inspected in regards to floor and wall coverings and general cosmetics. You should be aware of obvious areas that need prep and paint, or replacement of coverings. These items represent the overall condition of home. The inspection of main components is the purpose of this inspection. Components such as structure, roof, plumbing, heating and electrical are main components. Utilities must be on for inspection of these areas. If the inspection report states that a utility is off (no water, no fuel, or no electrical) then any item relating to these components cannot be inspected. Always consider having the utility on in order to inspect these areas. There is a fee for a return trip to re-inspect.</comText>

Service wires on this panel has been changed therefore the meter base should have been upgraded. I recommend a licensed electrical contractor inspect and correct as needed.</comText>

		<comText>The Refrigerator can often be one of the most energy consuming appliances you have in the home. A standard frost free refrigerator may only use 400 watts when on compared to a microwave's use at 1400 watts. However the refrigerator is on a lot more than the microwave. For most appliances, the amount of watts used and the time or duration of operation is not nearly as much as a refrigerator. For instance, a microwave may use 1400 watts but is only used say 175 hours a year and would cost about $30 annually. A 100 watt light bulb left on for 7 hours a day would be about $30.66 annually &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;(example 7hrs a day times 365 days times 100 watts times .12 cents per kWh (or whatever your power company charges) divided by 1000 (kilowatts) = cost per year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font color="#00ff00"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#003300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Tip:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Try to use &lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; refrigerator for the home and eliminate the need for a freezer or more refrigerators. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;</comText>

		<comName>5 year homes</comName>
		<comText>Homes more than 5 years old may have areas that are not current in code requirements. This is not a new home and this home cannot be expected to meet current code standards. While this inspection makes every effort to point out safety issues, it does not inspect for code. It is common that homes of any age will have had repairs performed and some repairs may not be in a workmanlike manner. Some areas may appear less than standard. This inspection looks for items that are not functioning as intended. It does not grade the repair. It is sometimes common to see old plumbing or mixed materials. Sometimes water signs in crawlspaces or basements could be years old from a problem that no longer exists. Or, it may still need further attention and repair. Determining this can be difficult in a lived in home. Sometimes homes have signs of damage to wood from wood eating insects. Having this is typical and fairly common. If the home inspection reveals signs of damage you should have a pest control company inspect further for activity and possible hidden damage. The home inspection does not look for possible manufacturer re-calls on components that could be in this home. Always consider hiring the appropriate expert for any repairs or further inspection.</comText>

		<comName>baloon ad included</comName>
		<comText>Dampers that do not seal well when closed (or no damper at all) can experience tremendous heat loss when the chimney is not in use or energy loss in the summer when cooling. When chimneys are located on the exterior side of the home (not in the middle), air loss can be even greater in winter. A good measure when the chimney is not in use is to install a chimney balloon that is reusable and is easily removed and installed. Attached is an illustration that you can use to install one yourself or we can do this as an added service.&amp;#160;</comText>

In severe cold temperatures, you may need to turn temperature setting up on water heater. This will also cause tap water at faucets to become hot.

		<comText>Fireplaces and Wood stoves have evolved tremendously over the years.The current thinking is that open fireplaces should be changed to a sealed fireplace that allows you to enjoy the flames and heat but all of the combustion gases and air pollutants go up the chimney. Old woodstoves are not as efficient and do not burn as clean as newer woodstoves. These woodstoves should be taken to the steel salvage yard and not re-sold to another person. Currently there is a US EPA campaign to remove old woodstoves and more information can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/changeout.html"&gt;The Great American Woodstove Changeout&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; An un-vented firelog system also releases unhealthy chemicals into the indoor air. Homes with unvented firelogs should be vented or replaced with sealed vented systems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air sealing or energy measures to weatherize the home should not be performed if an unvented combustible appliance is in the home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</comText>

		<comText>The various items below are recommendations aimed to reduce energy loss. There may be some areas below that you can do yourself and may give immediate return on investment. If the results of this Home Energy Survey and the interview indicates your home can benefit from further diagnostic testing or a CHEA &amp;quot;Comprehensive Home Energy Audit,&amp;quot; your Home Energy Survey Professional will inform you, or will indicate it below. Further testing could be a benefit to you revealing precise locations of air leaks and energy loss in the home. Your HESP may refer you to a qualified BPI certified Building Analyst and RESNET Rater to determine precise causes of energy loss and give clear answers on how to correct and save energy.

		<comText>I do not inspect the liner because often it would require disassembly of vent pipe either at Woodstove or vent hood on roof. Also, black powder dust is expected and should be cleaned from inner walls of liner in order to properly inspect for breaks or loose sections. I recommend a qualified chimney sweep clean and inspect for safety.</comText>

		<comText>Your heat system is hydronic forced air which uses the hot water from water heater in order to make heat. In severe cold temperatures, you may need to turn temperature setting up on water heater. This will also cause tap water at faucets to become hot. A mixing valve is then used to add cold water to the hot tap water. Your mixing valve is a black knob with a red top that you turn clockwise to add cold water to the hot. It is located *LOCATION(plumbing/mix-valve)*. This knob is only needed during frigid temperatures requiring a hotter heat at registers. FYI</comText>

		<comName>no duct test performed</comName>
		<comText>This inspection did not include a duct leak test. Duct piping leaks can be a major and significant contributor to high energy costs due to uneven pressure in rooms and bringing in unconditioned air (hot or cold), or by leaking conditioned air into unconditioned spaces. Please ask me for more information if desired about duct leak testing and sealing.</comText>

		<comName>Pool disclaimer</comName>
		<comText>&lt;P align=left&gt;Pools are fun, but children and adults can lose their life quickly. Over 4000  lives annually are lost with one-third  under the age of 14. &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A child can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; A swimming pool is 14 times more likely than a motor vehicle to be involved in the death of a child age 4 and under. An estimated 5,000 children ages 14 and under are hospitalized due to near-drownings each year; 15 percent die in the hospital and as many as 20 percent suffer severe, permanent brain damage. Of all preschoolers who drown, 70 percent are in the care of one or both parents at the time of the drowning and 75 percent are missing from sight for five minutes or less. Drowning surpasses all other causes of death to children age 14 and under in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A &lt;U&gt;pool alarm&lt;/U&gt; with a loud speaker system to sound outside as well as inside the home could save a life. Even if you do not have children you should be concerned. 35% of children that drowned did so &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in someone else's pool. For more info, do an Internet search on pool safety or visit this website:  &lt;A href="http://www.ihf.org/foryourhealth/article_children.html"&gt;http://www.ihf.org/foryourhealth/article_children.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</comText>

		<comName>clay liners oil now gas</comName>
		<comText>Clay liners that once were used with oil furnaces, and are now being used for venting gas or propane furnaces or water heaters may deteriorate called "Spalling." This is from oil residue absorbed in the liner that breaks down from the gas residue. Because of this potential problem, most chimney sweeps will eventually recommend a liner replacement. For this reason, I recommend a qualified chimney sweep inspect for safety.</comText>

		<comName>attach balloon brochure</comName>
		<comText>Dampers that do not seal well when closed (or no damper at all) can experience tremendous heat loss when the chimney is not in use or energy loss in the summer when cooling. When chimneys are located on the exterior side of the home (not in the middle), air loss can be even greater in winter. A good measure when the chimney is not in use is to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;install a chimney balloon &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;that is reusable and is easily removed and installed. Attached is an illustration that you can use to install one yourself or your inspector can do this as an added service. Stop the air loss up your chimney when its not in use. Install a chimney balloon! &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;(see the attachment page to learn more)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</comText>

		<comName>cost per appliance</comName>
		<comText>Baseload consumption represents the energy used by your lifestyle and needs other than to heat or cool your home. Water heating, refrigeration, laundry cleaning, entertainment, lighting and appliance use.&lt;p&gt;A sample measurement of energy use was taken on your appliances listed below. The &amp;quot;Monthly Estimate Total&amp;quot; or MET in kilowatt hours (kWh) of each appliance can be multiplied by the power company rate that they charge you per kWh to determine an estimate of how much energy dollars you are spending to use that appliance. This sample measurement was just a snapshot. A more accurate measurement would be to leave the measuring device in place for more hours (even a month's worth) to measure your habits or use of the appliance over a longer average. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See your energy inspector to purchase these low cost devices and monitor your appliance's energy use yourself or ask about longer testing services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>The Building shell in this report represents the outer surface area of the home. The inspector looks for thermal breaks in the shell such as siding missing, holes drilled through the outer covering (for hvac or plumbing etc.), gaps or breaks in the covering. Many homes have different designs and porches, roofs, bow outs and bow ins that can be prone to air leaks.The inspector observes these areas and may recommend sealing at areas that appear to need a better air seal. Shading of the home, skylights and other components that directly effect the building shell is noted when improvements or suggestions can be made.</comText>

		<comName>Dryer pipe conversion</comName>
		<comText>Your dryer vent appears to be intact but is flexible and not metal rigid piping. Cleaning the dryer vent piping is recommended every 3 years. It is easier to clean a rigid pipe and flexible piping can trap lint. Dryers that do not have sufficient volume to discharge the hot moist air will leak it into the room or building components. The warm moisture (latent heat) in the air can cause mold on walls or inside wall cavities. It can cause energy loss due to uneven house pressures it causes when on or can make an AC work longer to cool and remove moisture. Dust in the air is unhealthy and a partially clogged dryer vent pipe can create a lot of dust particles. &lt;p&gt;Our company provides a service to clean rigid dryer piping and we also replace old flexible vent pipe with metal rigid piping from the dryer location to the outdoors. Should you decide to do this yourself or hire another company besides ours, it is important for the installer to properly air seal wall or floor penetrations (usually with spray foam) and repair or protect the shell of the thermal boundary where the pipe penetrates the walls or floors of home. I will be happy to provide you a free quote if interested.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comName>Alum wiring long desc</comName>
		<comText>Aluminum wire is installed on 120 VAC branch electrical circuits in the subject house. These single strand, branch circuit aluminum wires were used widely in houses during the mid 1960s and 1970s. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, problems due to expansion can cause overheating at connections between the wire and devices (switches and outlets) or at splices, which has resulted in fires. For further information on aluminum wiring contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission via the Internet at &lt;A href="http://www.cpsc.gov/"&gt;http://www.cpsc.gov/&lt;/A&gt; . It is recommended that the electrical system be evaluated by a licensed electrical contractor.</comText>

		<comName>std wh used as hydro</comName>
		<comText>Your water heater serves not only to provide domestic hot water (i.e. bathing, dishes, cooking etc.) but also provides the heat for the home (Hydronic). Hydronic water heaters have a higher BTU or ability to heat water hotter than a"Standard" water heater. However your water heater is a "Standard" water heater modified to also heat your home. This means that some Heating Contractors or Public Service Gas companies may differ on opinion as to whether or not this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the home. Because this Standard water heater has been in place for sometime, one can infer that if it was not adequately heating the home, the previous owners more than likely would have replaced it with a "Hydronic" water heater. I am unable to determine if this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the home and recommend you obtain a second opinion.</comText>

		<comText>Your dryer vent piping *DEFECT(ventilation-dryer-connections)*. Repairs are needed. I recommend rigid piping be installed from the dryer to the outdoors. While a total replacement may not be necessary to correct the defect, proper dryer vent piping is essential for health, safety, energy and the durability of the building. A dryer vent pipe should be cleaned at least every three years and a rigid pipe can be cleaned more efficiently. &lt;p&gt;Our company provides a service to clean rigid dryer piping and we also replace old flexible vent pipe with rigid piping from the dryer location to the outdoors. Should you decide to do this yourself or hire another company besides ours, it is important for the installer to properly air seal wall or floor penetrations (usually with spray foam) and repair or protect the Building Enclosure 's thermal boundary where the pipe penetrates the walls or floors of home. I will be happy to provide you a free quote if interested.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>Dryer vent piping is an often overlooked component that deserves attention for safety, energy and durability of the home. Clogged dryer vents can and has caused house fires. Dryer vents should be cleaned at least once every 3 years. The problem is that flexible piping can trap lint and is difficult to clean. A clogged or partially clogged pipe can release latent moisture and heat in the air of the home that can cause mold, dust particles in the air and moisture that affects the durability of the home. The best solution is to install a rigid metal piping which can be easily cleaned at least every 3 years.</comText>

The water pressure or volume and whether it was adequate. 2. Any odors or color in water that may indicate a filter or correction is needed. 3. Any water filtration or flush systems. 4. Whether or not Hot and Cold is reversed on any faucets. 5. Water temperature. 6. Functional flow (whether or not is adequate) 7. Plumbing fixtures or piping that may leak or drip. 8. Waste line and drainage 9. Noisy piping or whether plumbing vents are working or not. 10. Whether or not the water heater will leak. Sometimes T&amp;amp;P valve can leak but only after water heater has been on for 24 hours or more. 11. Heat systems that require water such as boilers that use radiators cannot be inspected without allowing the radiators to work fully. Some radiators that are old may take hours to fully work. Turning the electric on briefly will not allow a good inspection of these radiators. Some radiators will leak but only after sufficient time to allow for radiators to fully work has occurred. 12. Heat systems that require water such as Hydronic cannot be inspected without water and electricity 13. Jet powered tubs cannot be inspected without water. There is a re-inspection fee to return and inspect should water be turned on. The inspection is not responsible for any item that is not working properly or was not inspected due to no water.</comText>

		<comName>dryer vent program</comName>
		<comText>Dear Homeowner,&lt;br /&gt;I am using this opportunity to share some information about your clothes dryer vent pipe. Did you know that no specific tradesman (electrician, plumber, Heat/AC etc.) keeps up with your dryer vent pipe? It seems to be a forgotten component that no trade adopts. That is why I want to share with you an over looked component than can cost you money or create a possible fire hazard. &lt;p&gt;Dryer vent piping material ideally should be rigid (not flexible) to prevent sags. Sags can and will clog a pipe causing moisture problems and affect the durability of the home. Moisture related problems too such as mold can occur. Sags will slow down the moisture in the air and cause your dryer to run longer which uses more energy. Small particles of lint etc. in the air is not healthy and a sagging vent pipe can lead to all these and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our company recommends a metal rigid pipe traveling the shortest distance to the outside and properly supported as it exits the home including air sealing around the pipe exit. Also it is just as important to provide an air tight secure connection from the dryer vent pipe to the dryer and enough room to slide the dryer out without damaging the dryer vent pipe or its connection to dryer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleaning: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dryer vent pipes should be cleaned every three years. It is near impossible to clean a sagging flex pipe but very effective and easy to clean a rigid pipe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I offer this service! I can change out your dryer pipe including the professional installation as mentioned above. We also do yearly and bi-yearly cleaning on all our installations. If you are interested, please let me know. I can provide a quote free of charge!&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>The flat roof (Less than 3/12 slope) at the *LOCATION(siding exterior)* has improper style roof covering (three-tab shingles). It should have either selvage, roll roofing, rubber membrane or an approved covering for a flat roof. The roof may leak in heavy rain or ice may dam in winter causing a leak.</comText>

		<comName>energy use (watt meter)</comName>
		<comText>An example of calculating energy use per appliance:&amp;#160; Let's say your freezer was plugged into a watt measuring device for (read the display when toggling kWh / time/hour button) 177 hours and used 28 kWh. This means that during the last 177 hours, this appliance used 28 kWh. To do a monthly average use of this appliance divide 28 kWh into 177 time hours to find out how much kWh are being used per hour. Then multiply that by the number of hours in a month (say 728 hours) to find out how much kWh this appliance uses in a month: &lt;p&gt;28 / 177 = .16 kWh per hour (approximate)&lt;br /&gt;.16 x 728 hours in a month = 116&amp;#160; total kWh used for that appliance in one month.&lt;br /&gt;116 kWh x .10643 (example for power company's rate) = $12.34 monthly cost of energy for this appliance.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comName>Washing Machines</comName>
		<comText>Washing Machines can be very cheap to use or very expensive. If you use cold water throughout, the cost can be less than 10 cents a load. If you use hot/warm some figures estimate as much as 60 cents a load. This cost involves the energy to run the machine as well as the energy used to heat the water. &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#003300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Tip: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Front end washing machines use less energy and they use less &amp;quot;heated water.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;2. Always use cold water for the &amp;quot;Rinse&amp;quot; cycle. Using hot or warm water during rinse does not get your clothes cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;3. Clothes that require hot water should instead be put in a warm &amp;quot;Pre-soak&amp;quot; which usually is more effective and cheaper than hot.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comName>old home</comName>
		<comText>This home is older than 50 years and the home inspector considers this while inspecting. It is common to have areas that no longer comply with current code. This is not a new home and this home cannot be expected to meet current code standards. While this inspection makes every effort to point out safety issues, it does not inspect for code. It is common that homes of any age will have had repairs performed and some repairs may not be in a workmanlike manner. Some areas may appear less than standard. This inspection looks for items that are not functioning as intended. It does not grade the repair. It is common to see old plumbing or mixed materials. Sometimes water signs in crawlspaces or basements could be years old from a problem that no longer exists. Or, it may still need further attention and repair. Determining this can be difficult on an older home. Sometimes in older homes there are signs of damage to wood from wood eating insects. Having this is typical and fairly common. If the home inspection reveals signs of damage you should have a pest control company inspect further for activity and possible hidden damage. The home inspection does not look for possible manufacturer re-calls on components that could be in this home. Always consider hiring the appropriate expert for any repairs or further inspection.</comText>

		<smHelp>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 kWh = 3413
Btu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Power in Watts = Volts x
Amps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;example: Air conditioner compressor name
plate shows compressor amps (12.1) the volts on the name plate says
230 volts so multiply 12.1 x 230 x .90 (Power Factor) = 2500 watts
or 2.5 kW of power needed for that compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power in KW x "Time" = Kilowatt "hours"&amp;nbsp;
(kWh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Example: Refrigerator power on name plate says
.24 KW (240 watts) times total hours in the year used say 5000
hours = 5000 x .24 = 1200 kWh x the cost per kWh from your power
company (10 cents = $120.00 a year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate energy use of lamps or
lighting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lamp quantity x lamp wattage x hours of use x 30 days divided by
1000 = kWh monthly usage. By year multiply by the cost per kWh x
12.&amp;nbsp; Note: when calculating the total light usage, group all
lights by wattage as well as the # of hours use per day. Next
perform the formula for each group. Add the totals, x 30 divided by
1000 x cost per kWh x 12 for the year's total. Retrofit cost
divided by the savings = simple payback in years even if it is less
than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SPB (Simple Pay Back)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = initial
investment divided by savings&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ROI (Return on investment)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in percentage=
annual savings divided by the initial investment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SIR (Savings to Investment Ratio)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; =
Lifetime savings divided by Lifetime costs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 horse power = 750 watts or .75 kilowatts... 2 hours of
horsepower = 1500 watts or1.5 kilowatt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;249 Pascals to 1 inch of water column&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;139,000 btu's = 1 gallon of #2 fuel oil (heating
oil)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 ton cooling = 12000 btuh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the area or room that has the combustion appliance in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SSE = Steady State Efficiency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: If the gas or oil &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is 100k BTUh and the&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; output &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is 81,000 BTUh then 
the SSE is .81 or 81% SSE&amp;#160; Formula: Output divided by Input &lt;br /&gt;
SSE takes into account the waste energy traveling up the vent/exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AFUE = Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Similar as SSE in so much that it takes into account the 
energy loss through exhaust, &lt;em&gt;but it also takes into account energy loss through the housing or jacket of 
the furnace and the loss during the cycling etc. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: Water heaters references to energy loss or net gain is not referred to as SSE but &amp;quot;Recovery 
Efficiency&amp;quot; and&amp;#160; we don't use the term AFUE, we use the term &amp;quot;Energy Factor&amp;quot;&amp;#160; which includes the 
&amp;quot;Standby loss&amp;quot; at the tank, jacket or housing and air that circulates through the water heater and up the 
chimney. The Energy factor is the potential energy that remains in the system to provide hot water at the 
tap which is usually 60% or less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide exterior air to open combustion appliances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

Tip:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Try the windows calculator under start/programs/accessories:&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Convert inches to feet:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Divide inches by 12 = feet&lt;br /&gt;
Quick Glance reference:&lt;br /&gt;
1&amp;quot; = .08&lt;br /&gt;
2&amp;quot;= .17&lt;br /&gt;
3&amp;quot;=.25&lt;br /&gt;
4&amp;quot;=.33&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Convert feet to inches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply feet times 12 = inches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Averages &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
divide the total by the number of samples taken = Average&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Example &lt;/u&gt;If you measured the thickness of loose fill insulation in an attic in 4 different areas you would 
total the measurements together and divide by 4 (in this example) to get an average thickness. &lt;br /&gt;
1.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 8 inches&lt;br /&gt;
2.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 8 inches&lt;br /&gt;
3.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 9 inches&lt;br /&gt;
4. 11 inches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total = 36 inches divided by 4 separate measurements = 9&amp;quot; average thickness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reciprocates (R Value versus U Value)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U value is the rate of heat transference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R Value is the rate of resistance of this transference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a U value and invert it to get the R value&lt;br /&gt;
Take a R Value and invert it to get the U Value&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Example: If I have a U value of .60 in a material (which is .60/1) I would invert it to get the R Value&amp;#160; 
(1/.60) 1 divided by .60 = 1.66 R value&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Example: If I have a R Value of 19 in a wall (which is 19/1) I would invert it to get the U value (1/19) or 1 
divided by 19 = .05&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;em&gt;: Use fractions to measure and total. Then convert fractions to decimals to calculate &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/2 = .5 so 1/2 is really 1 divided by 2 =.5 is really 5 tenths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/4 = .75 so 3/4 is really 3 divided by 4 = .75 (hundredths)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5/8 is really 5 divided by 8 = .625 (thousandths)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/16 is really 3 divided by 16 = .1875 (the thousandths)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: &lt;em&gt;Rounding of your fractions to the &amp;quot;Tenths&amp;quot; is usually good enough. So, Pi is 3.14 (good enough)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triangles are easy! A triangle is really &amp;quot;Half&amp;quot; a rectangle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So measure the base length of the triangle (width) times the height&amp;#160;and then divide your answer by 2 
and the answer is in square feet. Or, Area = 1/2 bh (which means 1 divided by 2 or .05 x base x height)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area = square feet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Square feet = length x width&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply in inches (length x width) = square inches , then divide by 144 to get square feet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example: 10 feet 4 inches (124 inches) times 20 feet 6 inches (246 inches) = 124x246 = 30,504 
square inches. Now divide by 144 = 211.83 square feet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cubic feet = length x width x height&lt;br /&gt;
or, Square feet x feet = Cubic feet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;u&gt; If you were measuring an attic or roof with a slope etc look at it from the gable side and treat 
it as a triangle. Measure the base x the height divide by two. Next multiply that square feet times the 
length of roof (across the front of home) = cubic feet or volume in cubic feet.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circles&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 measurements:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Circumference = the complete distance or 360 degrees&lt;br /&gt;
2. Diameter = the distance across the circle&lt;br /&gt;
3. Radius = half the circumference&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tip: The Radius is used to calculate the area.&lt;br /&gt;
Diameter x Pi (3.14) = circumference. In other words it takes the diameter about 3.14 times to go linear 
around the circumference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example measuring a ductpipe:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Pi (3.14) times Radius squared = Area&lt;br /&gt;
The ductpipe is 6 inches in diameter. To get the Area you would multiply 3.14 x 3 squared but solve the 
squared first (3 squared is 3 x 3 or 9) The math problem will be 3.14 x 9 = 28.26 squared inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ratio &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is a relationship between two quantities. If you knew the Area (L x W = sq ft) in a crawlspace 
and you knew the total Area of crawlspace vents, you could form a Ratio. &lt;br /&gt;
Example: If the crawlspace area totaled 900 square feet and it was closed except for 2 vents that were 
1sq ft each the ratio is 2 sq ft of ventilation for 900 sq ft of crawlspace 2:900&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slope or Pitch of roof = Rise and Run. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
12 is always the run. For every 12 inches in run the roof rises x where x = the slope&lt;br /&gt;
4 and 12 slope&amp;#160; the roof rises 4 inches for every 12 inches. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; The slope can be determined with a 4 feet level. Get on the roof and place one end of the level on 
the sloped roof (high side). Level the bubble with the earth and measure down from the end of the level 
to the roof covering and divide by 4 (4 feet level used) or divide by 2 (when a 2 feet level is used).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can also measure the gable end to get the slope. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Find the Run and then Find the Rise&lt;br /&gt;
Measure from the center of gable (along the bottom) to the roof edge on half the roof in inches (Run). 
This answer needs to be in 12&amp;quot; so divide by 12 to determine how many increments. Next measure 
vertically from the bottom center of gable to the peak (Rise) in inches. Divide this number in inches by 
the amount of increments you came up with when you divided the run. Convert to inches to find the 
pitch of roof.&amp;#160; Lets say we have 24 feet run and a 13' Rise. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Run: Convert to inches 24 x 12&amp;quot; = 288 inches divided by 12 inches = 24 &amp;quot;12 inch increments.&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;2. Rise: 13 x 12 inches = 156&amp;quot; divided by 24 increments = 6/12 roof pitch (6.5 &amp;quot; slope to be exact) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pythagorean Theorem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;
is 3 sides of a triangle and you know what two of the three sides measure but you want to know the 
remaining side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Formula is:&lt;br /&gt;
1.&amp;#160; a squared + b squared = c squared&lt;br /&gt;
2. c squared is = to the square root of a squared + b squared&lt;br /&gt;
3. Replace a and b with the actual numbers and multiply themselves together and then add the two.&lt;br /&gt;
4. what x what is equal to #3 ?&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; = C&amp;#160; (loses the squared)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Draw half of a gable end roof like a triangle on a piece of paper (go ahead and do it). The 
vertical center of gable is &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; and the bottom part of the right triangle is &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; and the slope side is &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; or 
unknown. Go ahead and mark a, b and c at each line of the triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; = 9'&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;b&amp;quot; = 12'&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; = ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write out the formula below in steps. Sorry for the long hand on symbols such as squared and square 
root etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;a squared + b squared = c squared&amp;#160; &lt;strong&gt;means&lt;/strong&gt; that &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; = the square root of 8 sq + 12 sq&lt;br /&gt;
9x9 + 12 x12 &lt;strong&gt;means &lt;/strong&gt;81 + 144 = the square root of 225 = C &lt;br /&gt;
what times itself = 225 ?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer 15'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what if you know one side say &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; and you know the slope side &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; then how would you find &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; ?&lt;br /&gt;
Let's say:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; = ?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;b&amp;quot; = 12'&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; = 15'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula:&lt;br /&gt;
Start with the&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pythagorean Theorem&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
a squared + b squared = c squared &lt;br /&gt;
Since this formula needs to = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; we need to get &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; over onto the &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; side&lt;br /&gt;
a = c squared - b squared&lt;br /&gt;
a = 15 x15 - 12x12 &lt;br /&gt;
a =&amp;#160; 225 - 144&lt;br /&gt;
a = square root of 81&lt;br /&gt;
what times itself = 81 ? Answer =&amp;#160; 9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Area of a Circle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Circumference = Pi times the diameter.&lt;br /&gt;
Area = Pi times Radius squared (Answer will be squared)&lt;br /&gt;
Example: &lt;br /&gt;
R = 4&lt;br /&gt;
D = 8&lt;br /&gt;
What is the Circumference?&lt;br /&gt;
C = 3.14 x 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is the Area? &lt;br /&gt;
A= 3.14 x 64&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Volume of a Cylinder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Volume = Pi times Radius squared times length&lt;br /&gt;
Answer will be in &amp;quot;Cubic&amp;quot; feet 
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br /&gt;
A section of 8 inch diameter duct 14.5 feet long has how much volume?&lt;br /&gt;
Formula:&lt;br /&gt;
First convert 8 inches to feet (8/12 = 0.66)&lt;br /&gt;
3.14 x (0.66 x 0.66) x 14.5 =&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; (Always do Parenthesis first)&lt;br /&gt;
3.14 x .44 x 14.5 = 20 cubic feet.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

Note: If there is an addition to home with different wall, ceiling, attic materials and perhaps ceiling 
height etc. this will need to be calculated separately from the rest of home.&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;1. Interview home owner (obtain energy bills monthly totals for the year (to reference therms, kWh use 
etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra note: What is the purpose of a Home Energy Survey? &lt;br /&gt;
a. to determine how much energy a home uses and whether or not it can be reduced and for how 
much. &lt;br /&gt;
b. Total energy used last year.&lt;br /&gt;
c. Separate Baseload and Seasonal use and the cost.&lt;br /&gt;
d. Review lifestyle with the cost of the Baseload.&lt;br /&gt;
e. Review the Seasonal cost with the idea of air loss of Building Shell&lt;br /&gt;
f. Determine if the Heat or Cooling Distribution system is contributing to the air loss by leaky ductwork 
and causing depressurization and more energy loss.&lt;br /&gt;
g. Determine if Solar gain is increasing energy costs (primarily for cooling expense)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1A. Determine Seasonal versus Baseload energy use. Convert to cost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Take a picture of each side of home and identify North,South, East and West. Note: We will use the 
picture instead of sketching the walls out on paper. This will eliminate an obsolete step and save lots of 
time. Make sure you take the picture to include both sides when possible. If you need to take two or 
more pictures to represent the side (due to size or complexity) be sure to include in the picture where 
the previous picture ended. We can &amp;quot;itemize&amp;quot; at the &amp;quot;Measurement&amp;quot; section.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
3. Measure exterior walls for each elevation and record them in the HG Spreadsheet (length and width 
respectively). You can measure windows if reachable or if desired while outside or wait until you are 
inside.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
Go inside and measure the ceiling height and record it in the HG Spreadsheet. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Load the outside pictures into the computer and place them in the &amp;quot;Measurements&amp;quot; section in the 
proper location (North South East West etc)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
6. Open the HG Spreadsheet and enter in the window measurements in the proper NSEW fields.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
7. The HG Spreadsheet needs a total for window area of the building.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
8. Measure and record the exterior doors and enter them in the HG Spreadsheet in the appropriate 
NSEW location&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9. The HG Spreadsheet needs a total for door area.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
10. The HG Spreadsheet needs to total the total area of windows and doors. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
11. Select the &amp;quot;Insert window measurements&amp;quot; onto the appropriate NSEW picture and drag the line at 
each measurement to the windows in the picture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12.&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
 Calculate the Area of the building using the HG Spreadsheet. &lt;strong&gt;Note: Not sure this is possible if 
the home is complex which would require pre calculating triangles etc before correctly 
determining square feet??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Calculate the Volume of the building using the HG Spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.&amp;#160;HG Spreadsheet create a field to enter CFM50 (Cubic Feet per minute at 50 pascals). Multiply by 
60 (always) and divide by Volume of home to get ACH50 (Air Exchanges per hour at 50 pascals)&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

		<smName>Window Terminology</smName>

		<smHelp>&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;U - Factor&amp;#160;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = Thermal Transmittance or BTU's per square foot per hour per degree Fahrenheit. Same 
as U Value&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; measure how much solar energy passes thru window. Will 
always be less than 1.0 as 1.0 is an open window.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Range is usually between .30 and .70&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Winter area .7 is better&amp;#160; (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;
Summer area&amp;#160; .3 is better (lower decimal is better)&lt;br /&gt;
Fact: Hot climates should use the SHGC when selecting windows as most important. &lt;br /&gt;
East and West use lower SHGC&lt;br /&gt;
Higher SHGC on South&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VT (Visible Transmittance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;#160; Low VT (darker) reduces overheating, glare etc. High VT allows more 
light and heat or glare&lt;br /&gt;
1.0 = open window&lt;br /&gt;
.5 or less is dark for residential, .7 or .8 is normal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Air Leakage) In the lab at 75 pascals pressure new windows have an AL range from .1 to 1.0 CFM 
per square foot. AL is not as important as U factor and SHGC (a homeowner misconception. The cool 
air they may feel at the window is usually convection from a poor U factor of the window).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IGU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Insulated Glass Unit)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coatings of the glass are used to block the sun spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Argon filling: Has more R Value than air and reduces convection currents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Low E + Low Emissivity &amp;#160;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows are usually not cost effective to replace when thinking of energy: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modeling software many times will project 100 years before payback on windows. Windows is a 
major expense and should not be priority before air sealing the home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fact: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Weatherization technicians can usually tighten a home to the point where it needs mechanical 
ventilation &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;(without tightening the windows).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;TIP: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Fans are a cheap source of cooling, however, they cool by convection and evaporation. They cool 
the human body but do NOT reduce the room temperature. If a fan is on in a an unoccupied room, they 
are not cooling they are wasting energy.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

		<smName>CFM50-ACH50-ACH50n- MVG</smName>
		<smEx>1</smEx>
		<smHelp>To get ACH: 
&lt;p&gt;When the blower door is at 50 pascals read the fan pressure (cubic feet per minute &amp;quot;CFM&amp;quot;50). &lt;strong&gt;Multiply 
CFM50 x 60 (to get hours) and divide by the volume of home. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Home is 3000 square feet with 8 feet ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume = 24000 cubic feet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFM50 = 4200 (blower door reading)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ACH = CFM50 x 60 / volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4200 x 60 = 252000 / 24000 = 10.5 ACH (Air changes per hour with the blower door)&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;CANT REACH 50 PASCALS SCALE: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the home is to big or to leaky and the fan will not create a 50 
pascal difference, use the scale below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When house pressure is at 15 multiply fan pressure reading by 2.2 to get CFM50 (approx)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20 use 1.8&lt;br /&gt;
25 use 1.6&lt;br /&gt;
30 use 1.4&lt;br /&gt;
35 use 1.3&lt;br /&gt;
40 use 1.3&lt;br /&gt;
45 use 1.1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Natural Air Changes per hour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Multiply the volume by the &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; factor First), then perform the 
same formula as ACH 50 which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CFM50 x 60 / (Volume x &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; Factor) ...Remember do parenthesis first!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;= ACHn&amp;#160; (Natural Air Changes per hour)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minimum Ventilation Guidelines uses the formula below to access the need for mechanical 
ventilation in the home (This is the old way ASHRAE 62-89)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACHn : Natural Air Changes per hour. This reading estimates the natural air exchange occurring in the 
home. To get this number use the same formula but multiply the volume times the &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; factor&lt;em&gt; first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; factor is a number you must get for your geographical area and is by zone. Within your zone 
will also be differing &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; factors by the number of stories of the building and whether it is protected from 
wind, somewhat shielded or exposed. You can get this chart in the book &amp;quot;Residential Energy&amp;quot; by 
Krigger-Dorsi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NC (zone 3): (S= shielded, N=normal E= Exposed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S-(1st story&amp;#160; 25.8)&amp;#160;&amp;#160;(1 1/2 story&amp;#160; 23.2)&amp;#160;&amp;#160;(2 story 20.6) (3 story 18.1)&lt;br /&gt;
N- (1st story 21.5) (1 1/2 story 19.4) (2 story 17.2) (3 story 15.1)&lt;br /&gt;
E- (1st story 19.4) (1 1/2 story 17.4) (2 story 15.5) (3 story 13.5) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Home is 3000 square feet with 8 feet ceilings zone 3 normal 1 story)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume = 24000 cubic feet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFM50 = 4200 (blower door reading)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ACH = CFM50 x 60 / volume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4200 x 60 = 252000 / (24000 times n factor of 21.5) Which means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4200 x 60 / 516000 = .49 Natural air changes per hour or &amp;quot;half of the air in the home will exchanged 
with the outside air every hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;To determine how much air change ACHn is needed:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(BPI) uses Minimum Building Airflow Standard or BAS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(RESNET) uses Minimum Ventilation Guideline or MVG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAS or MVG using CFMn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;= .35 x volume of home divided by 60&lt;strong&gt; or&lt;/strong&gt; 15CFM x # of occupants &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do both and use the larger one as the BAS CFMn for this home&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To&amp;#160;convert it to CFM 50 for blower door use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiply the BAS CFMn x the &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; factor for this home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: IF THIS IS DONE PRIOR TO AIR SEALING YOU CAN STOP THE AIR SEALING BEFORE 
YOU GO PAST THE MINIMUM BAS AND NOT HAVE TO INSTALL MECHANICAL VENTILATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW way does not use the n factor or a formula to bring back the blower door for MVG. Instead, it 
assumes that you should install a continuous fan so it determines the flow rate of the fan without the 
need for a blower door to help you determine MVG (ASHRAE 62.2-2007)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula: (7.5 CFM times per person or 7.5 times # bedrooms plus 1) &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; (.01 times square feet) = 
CFM power for a continuous fan. Also called an air to air ventilator or a HRV &amp;quot;Heat Recovery 
Ventilator.&amp;quot;&amp;#160; A HRV sucks air out of the house and brings in air from the outside. It is best to attempt to 
connect the exhaust or to suck air from the bathroom and kitchen as these rooms have odors and 
moisture. The Heat recovery part of the ventilator removes the heat from the air that is being sucked out 
of the kitchen and bathroom and gives it to the air coming in from the outside which reduces the 
penalty we have of bringing in unconditioned air for Minimum ventilation (MVG). NOTE: The alternative 
(a leaky house) has much more penalty than sealing a home and installing a HRV. So, its like 
removing the stale air out of the kitchen and bath and bringing in fresh air to the LR and bedroom(s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 1 HRV as above for an air tight home.&lt;br /&gt;
Option&amp;#160; 2 is a Supply fan used in conjunction with the air handler (for less air tight homes) Uses 
positive pressure for the home (warm climates)&lt;br /&gt;
Option 3 an Exhaust fan with a timer (for less air tight home) Uses negative pressure (cold climates)&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

		<smName>Formulas and notes for Heat Loss</smName>
		<smEx>1</smEx>
		<smHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Heat Loss Formula&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; q = U x A x ?T&amp;#160; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word definition: How much heat in a BTU Hour (q) transmits through building materials (U) of a specific 
area (A = Square feet) at a difference in temperature&amp;#160;&amp;#160; (?&lt;font face="MS Shell Dlg 2" size="1"&gt;
 T= &lt;/font&gt;Difference in Temperature or Delta T in 
Fahrenheit)&amp;#160;which is based on a 65 degree indoor temp and the outside winter design temperature 
found using a climatic chart. &lt;em&gt;(Residential Energy Book.)&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To get the:&lt;br /&gt;
U factor, first determine the R-value then divide 1 by that R-value&lt;br /&gt;
(example) R-value of 20 or&amp;#160; 1 divided by 20 = .05 U value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area = Square feet (length times width of surface)&lt;br /&gt;
(example) walls 9 feet tall times 40 feet in total width = 360 square feet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;?T = 65 degrees minus the outside temperature of your region which is derived from the climatic chart.&lt;br /&gt;
(example from Baltimore MD is 12) or 65 -12 = 53 degrees difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.05 x 360 x 53 = 954 BTU per hour of heat loss on this wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note: This formula can be used to calculate the heat loss (heat transmission) of the entire home&amp;#160;in 
ceilings, walls, doors, windows and floors.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: When calculating heat loss to get to true R-value you must figure the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Area Weighted 
Average.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; In other words if the stated insulation R-value on a wall is 21 you must subtract the areas 
that do not have a R 21 on that wall including the wall framing, windows doors etc.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: To get &amp;quot;NET&amp;quot; area of walls is to calculate the area's square feet minus the square feet area of 
windows and doors. The total wall width is usually measured from the exterior wall and the vertical 
height of the wall is measured from the interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: Other factors for a &amp;quot;Total Heat Load calculation&amp;quot; also involves air infiltration rate, ventilation rate, 
solar gain and internal heat load.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

		<smHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TIP: Why Bigger is not better!&amp;#160; Oversized equipment has been common but it is a real 
problem that should be corrected&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: 
&lt;p&gt;1. Many times the HVAC person would purposely put one size more than needed to make sure he 
does not get call backs on extremely hot or cold days. When a home is properly air sealed, these 
units that were oversized to begin with are now really oversized and can cause problems if not adjusted 
or replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Before a homeowner replaces their old unit they should first have their home air sealed as 
they may end up with a much smaller size needed and can save a lot of energy/money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Oversized units cost more to install than correctly sized equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Oversized equipment cycles on and off more frequently and:&lt;br /&gt;
a. wastes electrical energy/money at the ends of each cycle&lt;br /&gt;
b. has a greater chance to freeze up coils&lt;br /&gt;
c. Wider indoor temperature swings&lt;br /&gt;
d. Poor humidity control that cause mold and rot (unit shuts off more before it can remove the moisture 
in the air)&lt;br /&gt;
e. More wear and tear on parts (cycles more often)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. A properly sized cooling system should run continuous on the hottest day of the year&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat Pumps and Air conditioners have the same components: Air handlers, outdoor and indoor coils 
(which are evaporators and condensers), and a compressor. The Heat pump has a reversing valve since 
it makes heat and cold and allows the coils to reverse roles either as an evaporator (cold) or a 
condenser (hot), but an Air conditioner does not have a reversing valve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat pump : Indoor coil and outdoor coil&lt;br /&gt;
AC&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; : Evaporator and Condenser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;Energy Efficiency Ratings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EER: Energy Efficiency Ratio :&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Usually used for window AC and ranges from 5 - 12 and reflects the 
number of BTUh removed per Watt hour.&amp;#160; (In California the EER is used to rate central AC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Remember: The higher the number, the better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEER: Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Used to Rate Central Air conditioners ranges from 6 - 17&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Same as an EER except that it calculates the cycle losses of energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COP: Coefficient of Performance: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Used for Heat Pumps and ranges from 1 - 3&lt;br /&gt;
Its a Ratio of kwh of heat removed to kwh of energy used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HSPF: Heating Seasonal Performance Factor:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Used for Heat Pumps and ranges from 5 - 10&lt;br /&gt;
Its a Ratio of BTU's of heat moved indoors to the amount of Watt hours used to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</smHelp>

While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration. It could be as simple as some nails need replacing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Establish the Worse Case. 
&lt;p style="COLOR: #010101"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Worst Case Depressurization Test&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This test procedure measures the pressure in the Combustion Appliance Zone (CAZ) and provides visual evidence of spillage potential. If there are any vented combustion appliances that use indoor air to vent combustion gases and which are not classified as a category 3 or 4 according to NFPA standard 54, then a worst case depressurization test shall be performed using the following protocol.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1.1. Check the combustion appliance zone for the presence of flammable or explosive material near a combustion source.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.2. Visually inspect venting system for proper size and horizontal pitch and determine there is no blockage or restriction, leakage, corrosion or other deficiencies that could cause an unsafe condition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.2.1. Inspect burners and crossovers for blockage and corrosion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.2.2. Inspect furnace heat exchangers for cracks, openings or excessive corrosion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.3. Close all the exterior doors and windows of the home.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.4. Close fireplace damper(s) if fireplace is present.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.5. Close any interior doors between the CAZ and the remainder of the house, ensuring that all vented appliances and exhaust fans have been turned off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.6. Measure the baseline pressure difference between the CAZ with respect to (WRT) outside (ambient) and baseline CO levels. Set the gauge to read pressure and record the baseline pressure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.7. Turn on all exhaust fans in the home (kitchen range hood, bath exhaust, clothes dryer, etc.) that exhaust air outside the building envelope.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.8. Record pressure in CAZ with respect to Outside.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.9. Turn on the air handler. Record pressure in CAZ with respect to outside. If air handler makes the CAZ more positive (or less negative), turn it off. If the air handler is kept on, close interior doors to any rooms that have no return registers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.10. If fireplace is present install blower door and set to exhaust 300 CFM to simulate fireplace in operation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.11. Record net change in pressure difference within the CAZ WRT outside between baseline and worst case depressurization conditions. Record the position of doors and conditions of fans and air handler. When CAZ pressure is lower (more negative) than the limits specified below, the work scope shall specify remediation through pressure balancing, duct sealing, and/or other&lt;BR&gt;pressure-relief measures, as applicable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.12. Turn on vented combustion appliance with the smallest Btu capacity. Operate appliance for 5 minutes then measure CO levels according to the carbon monoxide test procedure below, and check appliance draft using a smoke pencil at the draft diverter. If the smoke is not fully drawn up the flue, the appliance has spillage under worst case depressurization. Record if there is any spillage and record CO levels. When spillage occurs or CO exceeds the limits specified below in section 9, the work scope shall specify remediation, including equipment repair or replacement, and/or building pressure remediation, as applicable. If both spillage and high CO are found during the test, the homeowner should be notified of the conditions and that it needs immediate remediation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.13. Turn on all the other combustion appliances, one at a time, within the CAZ and&lt;BR&gt;repeat step 1.12 on each of them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14. If spillage or high CO occurs in any appliance(s) under worst case depressurization, retest that appliance(s) under natural conditions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.1. Turn off the combustion appliances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.2. Turn off the exhaust fans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.3. Open the interior doors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.4. Let the vent cool.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.5. Test CO and spillage under natural conditions. If the test failed under worst-case, but passes under natural conditions, the work scope shall specify building pressure remediation, as applicable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.14.6. If an appliance fails under natural conditions, the RAuditor shall inform&lt;BR&gt;the homeowner of the problem, and the work scope shall specify&lt;BR&gt;remediation, including equipment or vent system repair or&lt;BR&gt;replacement, as applicable.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: If using a smoke stick at the bottom of an interior door determining which doors are to be opened and which doors to be closed: &lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;If the smoke comes to your nose, leave the door closed.

		<iiHelp>( OIL FURNACES ) over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Meanwhile, check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). An irratic movement of damper lid and soot build-up should be noted. Furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition of furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. If it's not running normal, recommend a licensed heat contractor service and repair as needed. Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. ( GAS FURNACES ) use a gas tracer around unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. If flame dances sharply or rolls under burner recommend service. Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition when furnace comes&amp;quot;on.&amp;quot; Use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). If over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. When in doubt, recommend a licensed heat contractor to inspect further. ( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well should still be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. ( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 60 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. The fan outside should be moving. And grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. The coils inside air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. ( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. There should never be an outlet on wall directly above electric base. Remove front cover on baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You can also offer and advertise dryer vent piping cleaning that will get you more replacement business as well as cleaning fees. Set up your customers to get emailed every 3 years for their Dryer vent pipe cleaning.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The piping must be strapped off properly and as straight and short of a distance as possible. Be sure and seal around the pipes vent hood at exterior to keep out moisture and insects. The pipe should be secure as it penetrates the wall or floor inside the home and properly air sealed around the pipe to prevent pulling air from wall cavities, crawlspaces or outside air. Any work requiring removal of sheetrock should also require proper insulating around the pipe inside the wall cavity and air sealing where obvious.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;While you are inspecting the gas lines, if the Dryer is powered by Gas or LP, you should make sure at a minimum that the vent pipe is rigid metal. Dryer vent piping should be cleaned at least once every 3 years. A rigid pipe will allow better cleaning than a flexible metal. The flexible plastic venting is considered unsafe for use with gas dryers (possible fire hazard). Some jurisdictions don't allow plastic flexible vent piping on any gas vented appliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note: This inspection item is excluded by default until you want to use it. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Optional Section 'Dryer Vent Piping" &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;is for those who wish to add this service to their business and then want to include this info on every CAZ inspection as a FYI to the owner. It is an overlooked component and can add extra income while helping to educate the public. It is excluded by default until you are ready to add this service to your business.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Some ideas to create a side business in dryer vent pipe replacement and cleaning is to offer the best quality installation such as:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;1. Rigid pipe versus flex. If an extra long pipe is needed a Y clean out midways is recommended.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2. If wall vent (as opposed to a floor or ceiling vent) use a "periscope vent accessory"&amp;nbsp; to eliminate a bent up pipe behind dryer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3. Use proper tie clamps and metal foil tape.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;4. Air seal where dryer penetrates thermal boundary with spray foam. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;5. Consider re-routing a pipe if vertical to make horizontal and no more than 18 feet long if posible. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You can search online for dryer vent accessories, or dryer vent&amp;nbsp;pipe cleaner etc. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If you use the&amp;nbsp;HomeGauge Time Released Messaging TRM &lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;you can set up to email a cleaning reminder every 2- years ec.&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.  These are walkable roofs and not too steep. 
&lt;LI&gt; Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling.

		<iiHelp>First, turn on the broiler in oven while touching element, turn off and check the bake element. Then check the support clips that hold the broiler and bake elements in place to make sure they're not missing or loose. Check the oven door for warp and inspect gasket seal. Check for burn marks at the oven doorframe for heat loss from failed gasket or door alignment or springs. Open close storage drawer for proper operation. Turn on all the burners to high, finger touch and turn back off. This method works and you don't have the risk of someone in home getting burned while elements are cooling down from high setting. On Gas stoves check all burners for even flame at all settings. Recommend cleaning if a burner delays ignition or if flames pop or if uneven.</iiHelp>

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.  &lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Vent Piping (gas water heaters or heat systems)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mainly this item is used for describing the visual condition of the venting system.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-bottom: 0mm; list-style-type: disk; "&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
Does the vent pipe rise 1/4 inch per foot?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
Does the vent pipe need high temperature mastic where it enters the chimney to provide a good 
seal? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
Is there any gas venting that exits home too close to the gas meter, a window or under a deck?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
Is the chimney leaning or are there signs of trim rework where the chimney contacts the wall of 
the home?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
When the gas furnace and gas water heater connect to one vent, the highest BTU unit needs to 
connect on the bottom. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
In most areas, the liners for wood burning stoves or fireplaces cannot share the liner with other 
fuel burning type units such as Gas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #0000ff;  "&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
Examine the vent pipe that connects furnace to chimney for rust or white deposits. This 
sometimes means that back drafting or poor drafting has occurred. Or the chimneys to big 
causing the warm vapor in the exhaust to condensate upon reaching the colder dense air in the 
chimney etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;For wood burning: usually 1/4 inch or more of creosote should tell you to recommend cleaning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;A chimney fire can sometimes occur on clay liners with no consequence if water was not poured 
on it from the fire department. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Water can crack the liner. Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a fireplace that has 
had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the roof on the 
shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this 
rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it to determine if a chimney fire 
occurred and if this liner is safe to use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="color: #010101;  "&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the insert to its liner. If not, 
creosote can collect on top of the insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can 
destroy a brick chimney - if not the home. Even if you cannot determine if a liner connecting the 
insert to the chimney liner exists, you should write up that it cannot be determined. &lt;/li&gt;

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

If all the water is not removed, then the pump is not adequate and more corrective action is needed.&lt;LI&gt;When recommending a sump pump be installed, you should think about trenches around the perimeter with gravel installed leading to the lowest area and a way to exit water from home without using the sewer system, so our taxpayer dollars don't treat the rain water.&lt;LI&gt;Think about electricity which usually requires an electrical contractor to install a GFCI outlet within reach of the sump pump cord (no extension cords).&lt;LI&gt; Don't forget the plastic vapor barrier. If all that makes sense then it may solve a water problem.  Another problem to look for is an approved sump pump container, not a bucket. What's the difference? A lot of difference, if a water infiltration expert comes behind you slinging mud. A bucket with a few drain holes in the bottom should work - but I would reference in my report that the bucket while appears to work fine is not an approved sump pump container as some repair specialist may note.&lt;LI&gt;Don't forget to raise the rod and float to see if it actually works.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Ambient air test is when you stick two meat thermometers into the main plenum of the air handler. One in the return air and one in the supply. Preferably near each other at the main trunk. If the AC has been running for an adequate amount of time before test you should see a range somewhere between 14 and 22 degrees. The supply should be the colder of the two. This test is not conclusive because of varying conditions but if it's out of range and the AC has had time to cool the home, then you can recommend an HVAC person (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If so, I recommend studying the basics of wiring and circuit breakers.&lt;LI&gt;14 Gauge=15 amp breakers and 12 gauge=20 amp breakers and so on.&lt;LI&gt;Go to Lowe's or Home Depot or your building supply store and hang out in the electrical wiring isle. Touch grab and feel. &lt;LI&gt;You could call up a few different electrical contractors (small outfits) and introduce yourself and your company and ask him if he would be interested in coaching you from time to time in exchange for referrals or a fee. Until you learn when to recommend an electrical contractor, you can explain to the buyer that this wiring method at the panel looks unfamiliar and you want to hold off on your condition call until you speak to an electrical contractor. Then call the electrical contractor and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn. Pass all panels that appear to be wired properly based on what is proper, and recommend an electrical contractor on everything else.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Measurement of CO (ppm) upon entering home</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;As soon as you walk in you need to take a CO measurement with your combustion analyzer and record it.&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take a measurement of CO levels within the home upon entering to establish a&lt;BR&gt;baseline. &lt;BR&gt;Do not measure near combustion appliances while they are operating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If ambient CO levels are higher than 35 ppm during normal appliance operation,&lt;BR&gt;turn off the appliance, ventilate the space, and evacuate the building. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The building may be reentered once ambient CO levels have gone below 35 ppm.&lt;BR&gt;6. For atmospherically-vented appliances:&lt;BR&gt;6.1. Take a measurement of vent gases upstream of (before they reach) the draft diverter.&lt;BR&gt;6.2. Appliance must operate for at least 5 minutes before taking sample.&lt;BR&gt;6.3. Take sample during worst-case depressurization test and/or under natural conditions, as required by paragraph 1.14. Record the CO level.&lt;BR&gt;7. For direct- or power-vented appliances:&lt;BR&gt;7.1. Sample must be taken at vent termination.&lt;BR&gt;7.2. Appliance must operate for at least 5 minutes before taking sample.&lt;BR&gt;7.3. Take sample during worst-case depressurization test and/or under natural conditions, as required by paragraph 1.14. Record the CO level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;TIP: It is a good idea to turn the thermostat for heating to "off" and the water heater to pilot now or soon after you enter home to prevent warming up the chimney before testing for spillage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.

		<iiText>DOORS (Interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. Check for holes in the door and for a doorstop. Note any trim missing, or hardware (check all doors). BASEMENT/CRAWLSPACE: Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water at all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter crawl space, look at each inside wall, left and right of entry, for water or mud marks on wall. If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and that it appears to work properly. Check to see if the door is delaminating on the bottom or deteriorated. SLIDING GLASS DOORS AND PATIO DOORS:  Open and close the door as needed and check for "Day light" and continuous weather-stripping. Also close the door with the knob until it latches. Then turn the deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. GARAGE DOORS: Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening. Document if the door reverses or not. If you use your hand to resist, and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if not careful. The door can "fold-up", damaging the door panel and chain drive. Even if the door has electronic sensors it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of the opener.</iiHelp>

Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

&lt;strong&gt;Do not start furnace or heat system yet until you're ready for the spillage test! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item is for mainly a visual inspection looking for abnormal venting signs or any obvious safety issue. 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Remember, if the filter is dirty leave it out for the CAZ depressurization test. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Furnace Inspection:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Forced warm air furnaces must be inspected for flame interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually inspect the burner as the blower fan comes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the flames burn differently when the blower comes on, a complete analysis needs to be performed to find 
the source of the flame interference. This problem must be referred to a heating contractor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cracked heat exchanger cannot effectively be repaired and must be replaced. &amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before a homeowner replaces their old unit they should first have their home air sealed as they 
may end up with a much smaller size needed and can save a lot of energy/money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

Therefore it is necessary to point this out in your report.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

It is impossible to look at a skylight installation and know if it will leak or not. Even when it looks perfect.&lt;LI&gt;Homes that have had a pressure washing company spray onto skylights can blow away, or push sealant caulking away, and cause leaks. You can't know what has happened since the skylight has been installed.&lt;LI&gt;Look for fresh paint inside at the skylight chase or tell-tale water marks that may only be condensation and not leaks.&lt;LI&gt;Vaulted ceilings with skylights can cause condensation in summer, if the ceiling air gets hot enough and an AC vent is mixing with hot ceiling air. Water droplets (or stains) can form on the ceiling. Sometimes it is difficult to determine which one is occurring in the home.&lt;LI&gt;Chimneys: Look for loose mortar above the roof line.&lt;LI&gt;Check the cement crown for cracks.&lt;LI&gt;White efflorescence or flaking of brick (spalling) indicates moisture is soaking into the brick somewhere.&lt;LI&gt;Do not try to remove metal hood bonnets on chimney to inspect liner. They sometimes are difficult to get back on or have been semi-permanently glued requiring a lot of work each time it is removed.&lt;LI&gt;Wood siding chimneys can deteriorate if metal hood does not completely cover outside corner boards.&lt;LI&gt;Stucco peeling away from the surface it is bonded to, is generally caused from moisture or a previously painted sub surface (painted masonry block that stucco is applied on).&lt;LI&gt; Brick divider walls separating flues are still found on many old homes. Loose or missing brick in these divider walls calls for a certified chimney sweep to inspect further.&lt;LI&gt; Roof penetrations: Know how to flash a chimney, install a vent pipe or vent fan hood flange into the weave of shingles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Gas Oven CO test at Steady State (ppm)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;U&gt;Range tops and ovens &lt;/U&gt;produce moisture and oxides of nitrogen.&lt;/FONT&gt; Excess moisture is not good for the durability of the home (possibly contributing to mold problems) and NOX is not healthy. These combustion appliances are capable of producing CO, which is a health hazard. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In all cases a carbon monoxide detector is recommended and homeowners should use exhaust ventilation when using these appliances. New appliances may require an extended warm up period to reach steady state.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;EM&gt;For LP- or natural gas ovens:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.1. Open a window or door to the outside.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.2. Remove any foil or cooking utensils within the oven.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.3. Verify that the oven is not in self-cleaning mode.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.4. Turn oven on to highest temperature setting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;8.5. Close the oven door and begin monitoring the CO levels in the kitchen, 5 feet from the oven at countertop height. Record CO levels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.6. Measure the CO levels within the oven vent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.6.1. Samples must be taken while burner is firing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.6.2. Operate burner for at least 5 minutes while sampling flue gases.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.6.3. If CO levels are higher than 100 ppm, repeat the flue gas sampling until the CO levels stop falling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8.6.4. Record the steady state CO reading in ppm and turn off oven.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9. If measured CO levels are higher than 100 ppm (200 for oven), or an appliance fails to meet manufacturer’s specifications for CO production (whichever is higher), the work scope shall specify replacement or repair of the appliance, and the homeowner shall be notified of the need for service by a qualified technician.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. If ambient CO levels exceed 35 ppm at any time, stop any testing and turn the combustion appliances off. Open all the exterior doors and windows. No one should enter the home until the CO levels drop below 35 ppm. The combustion appliance causing the increase in CO levels must be repaired by a qualified technician prior to completing the combustion appliance tests, unless the work scope calls for replacement of the appliance(s).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Since all gas tops generate CO and it is difficult to simulate an actual operating condition for these appliances during the course of a typical house inspection, specific action levels for these burners are not specified. However technicians must specify appropriate measures to mitigate potentially dangerous CO production of these units. ASHRAE exposure limits for CO shall be referenced when making a recommendation for CO control in these areas. The recommended ASHRAE limit for 24 hour exposure of 9 ppm shall be applied to building occupants. In most cases it will not be possible to effectively test for this condition, however the following measures shall be recommended whenever gas cook tops exist in the home:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;UL style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0mm"&gt;
&lt;LI style="COLOR: #010101"&gt;If burners do not ignite properly or do not burn cleanly, a clean and tune of the appliance shall be recommended. 
&lt;LI style="COLOR: #010101"&gt;If the appliance s located in a confined space and mechanical ventilation is not readily available, mechanical ventilation shall be recommended. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventilation provided for unvented gas ovens must provide a minimum capacity of 25 cfm continuous airflow or 100 cfm intermittent.&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Gas Dryer vent pipe</iiText>
		<iiHelp>While you are inspecting the gas lines, if the Dryer is powered by Gas or LP, you should make sure at a minimum that the vent pipe is rigid metal. Dryer vent piping should be cleaned at least once every 3 years. A rigid pipe will allow better cleaning than a flexible metal. The flexible&amp;nbsp;plastic venting is considered unsafe for use with gas dryers (possible fire hazard). Some jurisdictions don't allow plastic flexible vent piping on any gas vented appliance. 
&lt;P&gt;ICC wants rigid metal: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;ICC:&amp;nbsp; M1502.5&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; "&lt;FONT color=#993300&gt;Duct construction. Exhaust ducts shall be constructed of minimum 0.016-inch-thick (0.4 mm) rigid metal ducts, having smooth interior surfaces with joints running in the direction of air flow. Exhaust ducts shall not be connected with sheet-metal screws or fastening means which extend into the duct. "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note: This inspection item is excluded by default until you want to use it. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Optional Section 'Dryer Vent Piping" &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;is for those who wish to add this service to their business and then want to include this info on every CAZ inspection as a FYI to the owner. It is an overlooked component and can add extra income while helping to educate the public. It is excluded by default until you are ready to add this service to your business.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Some ideas to create a side business in dryer vent pipe replacement and cleaning is to offer the best quality installation such as:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;1. Install rigid metal pipe. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2. If wall vent (as opposed to a floor or ceiling vent) use a "periscope vent accessory"&amp;nbsp; to eliminate a bent up pipe behind dryer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3. Use proper tie clamps and metal foil tape.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;4. Air seal where dryer penetrates thermal boundary with spray foam. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;5. Consider re-routing a pipe if vertical to make horizontal and a long run may need a booster pump (inline). &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You can search online for dryer vent accessories, or dryer vent&amp;nbsp;pipe cleaner etc. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If you use the&amp;nbsp;HomeGauge Time Released Messaging TRM &lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;you can set up to email a cleaning reminder every 2- years ec.&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiText>Heat System Draft test</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The homeowner shall be notified of the results of all combustion safety tests.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Draft Test on all combustible appliances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draft testing (and Spillage) must&amp;#160; be completed for all natural and induced draft space heating systems 
and water heaters. Spillage and Draft must first be tested under worse case conditions, and then 
repeated under natural conditions if it fails the worse case test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;When drilling the vent pipe: Draft test location should be approximately 1-2 feet downstream of the 
appliance draft diverter. The test hole must be sealed with an appropriate plug after the test (some use 
metal foil tape).&lt;/u&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;#160;Acceptable Draft Test Ranges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this test is using the manometer in the vent pipe of the combustion appliance after Steady 
State, after the spillage test. The manometer is WRT the CAZ (reference A bottom port open and high 
port A has the tubing that goes into the vent pipe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula = &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Outside temperature divided by 40 - 2.75 = Minimum draft pressure standard (Pa).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 
This number (a negative) means that after Steady State the pressure in the vent cannot be 
more positive. A more positive pressure means that the exhaust is slowing down more than 
the minimum draft allowed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If outside temperature is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;less than 10F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the minimum draft pressure is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-2.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If outside temperature is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;more than 90F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the minimum is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-.05&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example: If your minimum draft pressure range was a -.5 and it read 0 or 1.2 pa etc. it would fail the 
test. If it instead read - 2 or -7 etc. it would pass the minimum draft test. &amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ambient CO levels shall be monitored upon entering the combustion appliance zone and during the 
test period for all appliances. If &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;ambient&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; levels exceed 35 ppm at any time, turn off the appliance 
immediately and make appropriate repair recommendations according to the charts provided.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Induced draft heating systems shall be checked for spillage at the base of the chimney liner or flue. If 
a chimney is shared between an induced draft heating system and a natural draft water heater, spillage 
shall be checked at the water heater draft diverter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unvented Appliances: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;No unvented combustion appliances may operate in the living space with the 
exception of gas ranges/ovens. Exhaust ventilation (to outdoors) must always be recommended 
whenever a gas or propane cooking appliance exists&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>This question is good for miscellaneous plumbing items or components such as pressure reducing valves, broken plumbing, incorrect or problem in plumbing. Outside faucets. To inspect thoroughly, do the basement or crawlspace last. By testing the faucets and drains first (inside the house) will allow you to discover leaks underneath. Trace all plumbing lines and look at the floor or plastic on floor for water or stains etc. Now's a good time to check for a P trap on the washing machine drain line. Also the Dryer vent piping.</iiHelp>

A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but not new construction. The problem occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic or PVC, which removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make sure the electric panel is grounded.&lt;LI&gt; Some electrical contractors say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a ground. I have heard some electrical contractors disagree and say that there is always a way to ground the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that "there is only one ground wire found on the panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed to non-metal and there is no ground". Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the panel. I recommend an electrical contractor add another ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrical contractor may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the home. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electrical contractors feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS.&lt;LI&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company.&lt;LI&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard.&lt;LI&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label.&lt;LI&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrical contractor. If a fire was to occur and later it was found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the panel states that no other brand is allowed.&lt;LI&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the form of litigation. Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it.&lt;LI&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself.&lt;LI&gt;Some local electrical contractors may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground.&lt;LI&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electrical contractors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.  &lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Summary: Did this home pass the Combustion Appliance Safety Test?</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;P&gt;Note: If a combustion appliance is dangerous based on CO leaking etc and its in the winter time it is not recommended to just walk away and hope they get the repairs fixed before they get sick or even die. You also, cannot really turn off a furnace and walk away and allow their pipes to freeze or them!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What do you do? This is more about safety than your time. You must arrange if necessary a safe solution. Do you open windows and tell them to leave on the furnace until a repairman decides to come by? Do you call the fire department and let them know the situation? Are these old people that need you to call their family members and warn them of your discovery? Is it a small leak that may become a big leak when you leave? Do you have a duty to make sure this family remains safe until a heating person arrives or until family members arrive?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Well, do ya?&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>FLASHINGS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there a lack of or improper flashing at wall junctions or chimneys?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does dormer siding have sufficient clearance from the roof?  Is it flashed properly?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Flashings are hidden most of the time, but you can go to the roof and wall junctions and tap on the shingle to see if it flexes away from the flashing underneath. 
&lt;LI&gt;Know what step flashing is, along with cap or counter flashing. The cap or counter flashing provides a hood over the step flashing and is bent and inserted into a masonry cut groove in brick or block. Flashing a rock chimney after a roof tear off is near impossible to do properly because you can't cut a groove in rock to tuck in bent flashing. The cap flashing is then laid flush and caulked at top, often failing in a short period of time. 
&lt;LI&gt;There is a product called Peel-n-Seal that is a foil backed sheet of tar and is pliable. It comes in a roll that can be cut with a knife and after peeling off wax paper can be molded to fit and seal against uneven surfaces like rock or stone. Some guys heat up the tar backing first with a butane torch for immediate sealing, depending on outside temperatures. This doesn't look as good as copper, but is a lot better than not installing proper cap or counter flashing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiText>Combustion Appliance draft test limit to be used at the time of the CAZ test</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acceptable Draft Test Ranges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this test is using the manometer in the vent pipe of the combustion appliance after Steady 
State. The manometer is WRT the CAZ (reference A bottom port open and high port A has the tubing that 
goes into the vent pipe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Formula = Outside temperature divided by 40 - 2.75 = Minimum draft pressure standard (Pa). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;em&gt;This 
number (a negative) means that after Steady State the pressure in the vent cannot be more positive. A 
more positive pressure means that the exhaust is slowing down more than the minimum draft allowed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example: If your minimum draft pressure range was a -.5 and it read 0 or 1.2 etc. it would fail the test. If it 
instead read -2 or -7 etc. it would pass the minimum draft test. &amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors).&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion.&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom .&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping.&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit.&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration.&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not.&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive.&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener.

		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can&amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights&amp;quot;Faint or Dim&amp;quot; and you press the button on the plug and it shows&amp;quot;Reverse polarity,&amp;quot; it may just be a&amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is&amp;quot;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it&amp;quot;Trips,&amp;quot; doesn't mean it&amp;quot;Killed the circuit.&amp;quot; It could be defective. New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

		<iiText>GARAGE DOOR (S)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on exterior door trim /jambs at bottom ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. The "jerk and let go" test for the garage door works best but there is a risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt; Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a home plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

		<iiText>BRANCH CIRCUITS-CONNECTED DEVICES AND FIXTURES (Report as in need of repair the lack of ground fault circuit protection where required.)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not"Trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can "Trip" a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity," it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is "Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "Trips," doesn't mean it "Killed the circuit." It could be defective.  New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the home, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the insert to its liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the home.

		<iiText>WATER HEATER EQUIPMENT</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing. Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of home) or possible leak at liner. Rust along bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heat elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU. See Discoveries and Auto Comments. Gas water heaters should be cranked up to come on and test draw at diverter with a match. If draw does not suck out flame on match, there could be a venting problem. White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in gas when not venting properly. A greasy residue on top of gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.</iiHelp>

		<iiText>WALLS (interior and Exterior)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Walls can tell you a lot about the house. Settlement cracks should be noted as minor or significant in relation to the structure or to the wall covering, as whether or not a repair is needed. Note if it is "Cosmetic" after you mention the crack, if you think it's ok. On an old house, push on the wall near a window to see if it gives, if you suspect deterioration or termite damage. Bowed paneling on a wall alerts you to moisture or possible water intrusion. Faint water signs can sometimes be found under windows and along the baseboard. Black flash marks on or around an outlet on the wall should be noted. Recommend a licensed electrical contractor inspect further. EXTERIOR: Circle the house slowly paying special attention behind shrubs or hard to reach areas. Check for loose or lifted nails, deterioration, paint peel, caulking at seams, joints, trim, along top of garage door and window brick mold. Swelling of composite siding with recessed nails, green alga areas. Ground clearance of six inches or better where possible is recommended.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Central Air should not be ran if outside temperature is at 65 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Turn on A/C and wait about 15 minutes or so. Grab and hold the suction line just before it enters air handler inside and feel for ice cold. (This will tell you if the compressor outside is making cold air). No cold feeling could mean  a number of things that will involve servicing the unit (low on refrigerant, leak, compressor problem etc.) Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. Recommend service. If the suction line is iced over where it enters Air Handler, the coils inside air handler may need cleaning. To check for ambient air, you would need the A/C to run longer than 15 minutes or so. Insert a thermometer in the supply plenum, and then insert another thermometer into the return-air plenum. The Return air should be within 20-25 degrees of the thermometer in the supply plenum. The amount of time the A/C would need to run before checking ambient air will vary, depending upon how hot it is inside when you first ran the A/C. This may require an hour or so to give the A/C a chance to work at it's potential.</iiHelp>

Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a home is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Home Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around footing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Screw jacks used as a permanent support might work, but some inspectors will consider them as "for temporary use only" and will recommend replacement (FYI).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Older homes)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Is the main girder supported every 8 feet or at seams?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule there should be a proper support and a proper footing under all girders at each end, and in between about every 6 feet or so. Older homes were spaced about 8 feet. The floor joist should have a proper support at each end. If there are some homemade supports in the middle of some joists, (usually found in older homes), you need to consider why they are there:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is there something heavy above the floor like a piano or heavy furniture?&lt;LI&gt;Are the floor joists undersized or is the span too far and beginning to sag?&lt;LI&gt;Is there a bounce in the floor above?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Floor joists are not supposed to need any support between the two ends. Theoretically, you should be able to remove those temporary supports. Ask yourself if you would? Or what problem would result? That's how I determine if these temporary supports are really needed. If they are, then they need to have a proper support and footing. Usually a properly installed drop girder that supports several joists at one time is recommended. If I think they are not serving much purpose, I'll note that the temporary supports do not appear to be serving any real support need for the joist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16.

Sometimes there are several in one home.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes.

According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening.

		<iiText>Heat System Spillage test, then CO measurement at Steady State of combustible appliances</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The homeowner shall be notified of the results of all combustion safety tests.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Perform the spillage test first!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spillage Test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most appliances will spill upon start up with a cold chimney. Document the amount of time it takes for 
spillage to stop and a positive draft to be established.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vented appliances, regardless of type, that spill flue gases for MORE than 60 seconds after 
start up, FAIL the spillage test.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
TIP: Use a mirror up close to the draft diverter and it will fog indicating spillage. The fog should clear 
before 60 seconds&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;CO tests shall be measured of undiluted flue gases in the throat or flue of the appliance using a digital 
gauge and measured in parts per million (ppm) at &amp;quot;Steady State&amp;quot; operating conditions&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Never drill in pvc exhaust vents (power vents or sealed combustion) as those are positive 
pressure pipes anyway. You can instead measure CO at the exterior outlet of the flue and proceed with 
appropriate actions according to the CO limits identified in the &lt;u&gt;Combustion Safety Action Level Table.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a chimney is shared by multiple appliances the appliance with the smallest Btu input rating shall 
be tested first&amp;#160; (Spillage and Draft) and remaining appliances tested in order of increasing input rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of unvented gas or propane cooking appliances, &lt;em&gt;CO must be tested in all 
combustible appliances under worse case conditions &lt;/em&gt;and normal draft conditions (when the appliance 
fails under worse case...allowing the chimney to cool first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the CO in any appliance is measured greater than 100 ppm during diagnostic testing, or the ambient 
CO in the home exceeds 35 ppm during appliance operation, an appliance clean and tune must be 
completed as part of the work scope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Combustion Safety Test Action Levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CO measurements of undiluted flue gases at &amp;quot;Steady State&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
0-25 ppm&lt;/font&gt; and Spillage and Draft test &lt;u&gt;PASSES&lt;/u&gt;, proceed with the work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
26-100 ppm&lt;/font&gt; and Spillage and Draft test&lt;u&gt; PASSES&lt;/u&gt;, Recommend that the CO problem be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
26-100 ppm&lt;/font&gt; and Spillage and Draft test &lt;u&gt;Fails at worse case only&lt;/u&gt;, Recommend a service call for the 
appliance and/or repairs to the home to correct the problem. NOTE: If appliance fails as above, then it 
must be retested under natural conditions to determine if it continues to fail. If so, read next level 
recommendations for when an appliance fails under natural conditions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
100-400 ppm&lt;/font&gt; &lt;u&gt;OR Fails under natural conditions&lt;/u&gt; Stop work (not inspecting, but stop any work involving 
air sealing, insulating etc.). Work may not proceed until the system is serviced and the problem is 
corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&amp;gt;400 ppm&lt;/font&gt; and the Spillage and Draft test &lt;u&gt;PASSES&lt;/u&gt; Stop work (not inspecting, but stop any work 
involving air sealing, insulating etc.). Work may not proceed until the system is serviced and the

		<iiHelp>Look at an old home with an old eye. Always note water stains and whether or not you can determine how old they are by a moisture meter, examining the area related in attic and on roof. On newer homes, note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tears or blemishes etc. See Discoveries and Comments</iiHelp>

Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up.&lt;LI&gt;Always note fire damage in the attic. And do a stab test to determine the strength. Sometimes the "Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend an engineer and repairs.&lt;LI&gt;Sags can occur where:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;a plywood clip is missing,&lt;LI&gt;a truss is damaged,&lt;LI&gt;rafters are spaced too far apart,&lt;LI&gt;there is a bad crown in the wood or&lt;LI&gt;you have a weak piece of plywood.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4 rafter" spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested.&lt;LI&gt;This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation as well as clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights.&lt;LI&gt;The chimney area often shows stains on wood from previously failed flashing or&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;from current. indirect light seen at flashing is sometimes not where it is leaking.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ridge line can show leaks where blow-in occurred or from faulty seams or from end caps being missing.&lt;LI&gt;This is a good time to trace out the ceiling exhaust fan vent pipes where possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#339966&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>SERVICE ENTRANCE AND PANELS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Circuit breaker brand should match the panel brand. An electrical contractor may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the home. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their own circuit brand only, or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electrical contractors feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS. WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company. Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard. General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label. When in doubt, recommend an electrical contractor. If a fire was to occur and later found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on panel states that no other brand is allowed. The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in form of litigation. Whether they do or don 't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it. There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself. Some local electrical contractors may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground. Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers wouldn't do it.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is insulation right side up? (Paper side faces the heated space).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The home inspector shall observe:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Insulation and vapor retarders in unfinished spaces; Ventilation of attics and foundation areas; Kitchen, bathroom, and laundry venting systems; and the operation of any readily accessible attic ventilation fan, and, when temperature permits, the operation of any readily accessible thermostatic control.

		<iiText>Water Heater Draft Test</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The homeowner shall be notified of the results of all combustion safety tests.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Draft Test on all combustible appliances&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Draft testing (and Spillage) must&amp;nbsp; be completed for all natural and induced draft space heating systems and water heaters. Spillage and Draft must first be tested under worse case conditions, and then repeated under natural conditions if it fails the worse case test. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;When drilling the vent pipe: Draft test location should be approximately 1-2 feet downstream of the appliance draft diverter. The test hole must be sealed with an appropriate plug after the test (some use metal foil tape).&lt;/U&gt; 
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&amp;nbsp;Acceptable Draft Test Ranges&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Remember,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This test is using the manometer in the vent pipe of the combustion appliance after Steady State, after the spillage test and while in Worst Case Depressurization. The manometer is WRT the CAZ (reference A bottom port open and high port A has the tubing that goes into the vent pipe).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Formula = &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Outside temperature divided by 40 - 2.75 = Minimum draft pressure standard (Pa).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; This number (a negative) means that after Steady State the pressure in the vent cannot be more positive. A more positive pressure means that the exhaust is slowing down more than the minimum draft allowed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If outside temperature is &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;less than 10F&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; the minimum draft pressure is &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-2.5&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If outside temperature is &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;more than 90F&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; the minimum is &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-.05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example: If your minimum draft pressure range was a -.5 and it read 0 or 1.2 pa etc. it would fail the test. If it instead read - 2 or -7 etc. it would pass the minimum draft test. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ambient CO levels shall be monitored upon entering the combustion appliance zone and during the test period for all appliances. If &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;ambient&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; levels exceed 35 ppm at any time, turn off the appliance immediately and make appropriate repair recommendations according to the charts provided.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Induced draft heating systems shall be checked for spillage at the base of the chimney liner or flue. If a chimney is shared between an induced draft heating system and a natural draft water heater, spillage shall be checked at the water heater draft diverter&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Unvented Appliances: &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;No unvented combustion appliances may operate in the living space with the exception of gas ranges/ovens. Exhaust ventilation (to outdoors) must always be recommended whenever a gas or propane cooking appliance exists&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is the water heater strapped securely to the wall (required in earthquake zones)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. If the gas line to the water heater or furnace could be bumped or ruptured by a vehicle, a pole or guard post "bollard"&amp;nbsp;should be recommended&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Use a lighter at the draft hood when the gas water heater is on to check for&amp;nbsp;draw. Note this is not a draft test! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of home) or possible leak at the liner. 
&lt;LI&gt;Rust along the bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heating elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. 
&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. 
&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. 
&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU. 
&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem. 
&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly. 
&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem. 
&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air). 
&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the home has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water. With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant home and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>Most everyone expects electric 220-volt connection for Dryer. Note if the only connection for dryer is gas. Note if both are available as a plus. Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. Many older homes still have 1&amp;quot;1/2 diameter wasteline and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may over run drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health dept or building safety on this issue. Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. The outlet for washing machine should be grounded if existing. A repair would be a GFCI outlet.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there a vapor barrier (6 mil recommended) on dirt floor of basement or crawlspace?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2.. Foundation vents should have screens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Floor spaces:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A vapor barrier is a roll of plastic (6 mil thick preferred) that is spread out over the crawlspace to keep moisture from entering the crawlspace from the ground. It is essential and inexpensive compared to its prevention abilities.&lt;/P&gt;

		<iiText>Water Heater Spillage test, then CO measurement at Steady State</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The homeowner shall be notified of the results of all combustion safety tests.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Perform the spillage test first!&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Spillage Test&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Most appliances will spill upon start up with a cold chimney. Document the amount of time it takes for spillage to stop and a positive draft to be established.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Vented appliances, regardless of type, that spill flue gases for MORE than 60 seconds after start up, FAIL the spillage test.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;TIP: Use a mirror up close to the draft diverter and it will fog indicating spillage. The fog should clear before 60 seconds&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;CO tests shall be measured of undiluted flue gases in the throat or flue of the appliance using a digital gauge and measured in parts per million (ppm) at "Steady State" operating conditions&lt;/U&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Never drill in pvc exhaust vents (power vents or sealed combustion) as those are positive pressure pipes anyway. You can instead measure CO at the exterior outlet of the flue and proceed with appropriate actions according to the CO limits identified in the &lt;U&gt;Combustion Safety Action Level Table.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;When a chimney is shared by multiple appliances the appliance with the smallest Btu input rating shall be tested first&amp;nbsp; (Spillage and Draft) and remaining appliances tested in order of increasing input rate.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the exception of unvented gas or propane cooking appliances, &lt;EM&gt;CO must be tested in all combustible appliances under worse case conditions &lt;/EM&gt;and normal draft conditions (when the appliance fails under worse case...allowing the chimney to cool first).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the CO in any appliance is measured greater than 100 ppm during diagnostic testing, or the ambient CO in the home exceeds 35 ppm during appliance operation, an appliance clean and tune must be completed as part of the work scope. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Combustion Safety Test Action Levels&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;CO measurements of undiluted flue gases at "Steady State"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;0-25 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; and Spillage and Draft test &lt;U&gt;PASSES&lt;/U&gt;, proceed with the work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;26-100 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; and Spillage and Draft test&lt;U&gt; PASSES&lt;/U&gt;, Recommend that the CO problem be fixed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;26-100 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; and Spillage and Draft test &lt;U&gt;Fails at worse case only&lt;/U&gt;, Recommend a service call for the appliance and/or repairs to the home to correct the problem. NOTE: If appliance fails as above, then it must be retested under natural conditions to determine if it continues to fail. If so, read next level recommendations for when an appliance fails under natural conditions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;100-400 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;U&gt;OR Fails under natural conditions&lt;/U&gt; Stop work (not inspecting, but stop any work involving air sealing, insulating etc.). Work may not proceed until the system is serviced and the problem is corrected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&amp;gt;400 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; and the Spillage and Draft test &lt;U&gt;PASSES&lt;/U&gt; Stop work (not inspecting, but stop any work involving air sealing, insulating etc.). Work may not proceed until the system is serviced and the problem is corrected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&amp;gt;400 ppm&lt;/FONT&gt; and &lt;U&gt;FAILS&lt;/U&gt; under any condition &lt;STRONG&gt;Emergency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Shut off the fuel to the appliance and have the homeowner to call for service or repairs immediately.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent. Many older homes still have 1&amp;quot;1/2 diameter wasteline and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may over run drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&amp;quot;Gray water&amp;quot; is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health dept or building safety on this issue. Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities. The outlet for washing machine should be grounded if existing. A repair would be a GFCI outlet.</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Freezer</iiText>
		<iiHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;An example of calculating energy use per appliance using a Watt meter:&amp;#160;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Let's say your freezer 
was plugged into a watt measuring device for (read the display when toggling kWh / time/hour button) 177 
hours and used 8 kWh. This means that during the last 177 hours, this appliance used 8 kWh. To do a 
monthly average use of this appliance divide 8 kWh by 177 time hours to find out how much kWh are 
being used per hour. Then multiply that by the number of hours in a month (say 728 hours) to find out how 
much kWh this appliance uses in a month: 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 / 177 = .045 kWh per hour (approximate)&lt;br /&gt;
.045x 728 hours in a month = 32.9&amp;#160; total kWh used for that appliance in one month.&lt;br /&gt;
32.9 kWh x .10643 (example for power company's rate) = $3.50 monthly cost of energy for this 
appliance.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;To determine the energy cost of an appliance: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Find out&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;how many watts the appliance demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Determine how long it is on in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Use your power company's rate per kWh (ex. .12 cents per kWh)&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Multiply the daily operating time (hours) x 365 days in a year = annual hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Multiply the total annual hours of use by the watts the appliance demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Multiply that total by the power company's rate (ex. .12 cents per kWh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Divide this by 1000 and you get the total cost per year for that appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Refrigerator uses 400 watts when in use.&lt;br /&gt;
2. refrigerating and defrosting = 15 hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;
3. 12 cents.&lt;br /&gt;
4. 15 hrs a day times 365 days = 5475 hours a year.&lt;br /&gt;
5. 5475 times 400 watts = 2190000.&lt;br /&gt;
6. 2190000 x&amp;#160; .12 cents = 262800.&lt;br /&gt;
7. 262800 divided by 1000 kWh = $262.80 yearly energy cost to operate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>ROOF STRUCTURE AND ATTIC (If the attic is inaccessible, report the method used to inspect)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed something. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. Always note fire damage in the attic.  And do a stab test to determine the strength of a charred area. Sometimes the"Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend repairs. Sags can occur where a plywood clip is missing, you have a damaged truss or rafters spaced a little too far apart or you have a bad crown in wood. Or possibly a weak piece of plywood. Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4" rafter spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation and clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. To get the R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply thickness in inches by 3.142857. For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. Or better yet, use the"AUTO COMMENTS." Insulation usually comes in four Types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand, Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock, Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals. Rigid Foam Board (used on the exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) is obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. A home can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.</iiHelp>
