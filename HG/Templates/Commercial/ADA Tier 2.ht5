allow those inspectors who do more ADA type inspections than ASTM Commercial. It also 
can be used to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;print the ADA inspection separate while performing an ASTM Report 
&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;allowing the inspector to print the ASTM&amp;amp;#160; in a narrative format (format 3) while printing the 
ADA report in Format 1 or the Grid form look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</tDesc>

and not for repairs or improvements that could be classified as: (1) cosmetic or 
decorative; (2) part or parcel of a building renovation program or tenant 
improvements/finishes; (3) enhancements to reposition the subject property in the 
marketplace; (4) for warranty transfer purposes; or (5) routine or normal preventive 
maintenance, or a combination thereof. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Threshold Amount for Opinions of Probable Costs.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It is the intent of this guide that 
the material physical deficiencies observed and the corresponding opinions of probable 
costs (1) be commensurate with the complexity of the subject property; (2) not be minor 
or insignificant; and (3) serve the purpose of the user in accordance with the user's risk 
tolerance level. &lt;em&gt;Opinions of probable costs that are either individually or in the aggregate 
less than a threshold amount of $3,000 for like items are to be omitted from the PCR.&lt;/em&gt; If 
there are more than four separate items that are below this threshold requirement, but 
collectively total over $10,000, such items should be included. &lt;em&gt;The user may adjust this 
cost threshold amount provided that this is disclosed within the PCR's Executive 
Summary under the heading Deviations from the Guide. &lt;/em&gt;Actual Costs May Vary. 
Opinions of probable costs should only be construed as preliminary budgets. Actual 
costs most probably will vary from the consultant's opinions of probable costs depending 
on such matters as type and design of suggested remedy, quality of materials and 
installation, manufacturer and type of equipment or system selected, field conditions, 
whether a physical deficiency is repaired or replaced in whole, phasing of the work (if 
applicable), quality of contractor, quality of project management exercised, market 
conditions, and whether competitive pricing is solicited, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Estimating of Quantities:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It is not the intent of this guide that the consultant is to 
prepare or provide exact quantities or identify the exact locations of items or systems as 
a basis for preparing the opinions of probable costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis of Costs. The source of cost information utilized by the consultant may be from 
one or more of the following resources: (1) user provided unit costs; (2) owner's historical 
experience costs; (3) consultant's cost database or cost files; (4) commercially available 
cost information such as published commercial data; (5) third party cost information from 
contractors, vendors, or suppliers; or (6) other qualified sources that the consultant 
determines appropriate. Opinions of probable costs should be provided with approximate 
quantities, units, and unit costs by line item. If in the reasonable opinion of the 
consultant, a physical deficiency is too complex or difficult to develop an opinion of 
probable cost using the quantity and unit cost method, the consultant may apply a lump 
sum opinion of probable costs for that particular line item. Opinions of probable costs 
should be limited to construction related costs; those types of costs that commonly are 
provided by contractors who perform the work.&lt;em&gt; Business related, design, management 
fees, and other indirect costs should be excluded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Costs for Additional Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. For some physical deficiencies, determining the 
appropriate suggested remedy or scope may warrant further study/research or design, 
testing, exploratory probing, and exploration of various repair schemes, or a combination 
thereof, all of which are outside the scope of this guide. In these instances, the opinions 
of probable costs for additional study should be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Opinions of Probable Costs Contingent on Further Discovery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;The consultant is not 
required to provide opinions of probable costs to remedy physical deficiencies, which 
may require the opinions of specialty consultants or the results of testing, exploratory 
probing, or further research to determine the cause of the physical deficiency and the 
appropriate remedy, scope, and scheme for repair or replacement unless user and 
consultant have agreed to such an expansion of the scope of work.&lt;/p&gt;</comText>

		<comText>&lt;P align=left&gt;Pools are fun, but children and adults can lose their life quickly. Over 4000  lives annually are lost with one-third  under the age of 14. &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A child can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; A swimming pool is 14 times more likely than a motor vehicle to be involved in the death of a child age 4 and under. An estimated 5,000 children ages 14 and under are hospitalized due to near-drownings each year; 15 percent die in the hospital and as many as 20 percent suffer severe, permanent brain damage. Of all preschoolers who drown, 70 percent are in the care of one or both parents at the time of the drowning and 75 percent are missing from sight for five minutes or less. Drowning surpasses all other causes of death to children age 14 and under in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A &lt;U&gt;pool alarm&lt;/U&gt; with a loud speaker system to sound outside as well as inside the building could save a life. Even if you do not have children you should be concerned. 35% of children that drowned did so &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in someone else's pool.

&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As required by the ADA, the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance 
Board promulgated the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines. 
ADAAG provides guidelines for implementation of the ADA by providing specifications for 
design, construction, and alteration of facilities in accordance with the ADA. These 
guidelines specify quantities, sizes, dimensions, spacing, and locations of various 
components of a facility so as to be in compliance with the ADA. X2.3 Variable Levels of 
Due Diligence&amp;mdash;For many users, especially those acquiring or taking an equity interest 
in a property, a complete accessibility survey in accordance with ADAAG may be 
desired. For other users, however, an abbreviated accessibility survey may serve to 
identify most of the major costs to realize ADA compliance without assessing every 
accessible element and space within and without a facility, and without taking 
measurements and counts. Any accessibility survey should be based on ADAAG, 
however. Appendix X2 provides the user with three tiers of ADA due diligence, which 
may be supplemented or revised in accordance with the user&amp;rsquo;s risk tolerance level for 
ADA deficiencies and the resulting costs to realize compliance. These tiers are: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tier I-Visual Accessibility Survey (a limited scope visual survey, which excludes the 
taking of measurements or counts); Tier II-Abbreviated Accessibility Survey (an 
abbreviated scope survey entailing the taking of limited measurements and 
counts); and Tier III-Full Accessibility Survey in compliance with ADAAG. ADAAG 
provides guidance only concerning federal requirements for ADA compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 
Some states and localities may have additional compliance requirements that will not be 
addressed by any of the levels of due diligence enumerated in this document. The user 
may desire a site-specific accessibility survey, in some instances.&amp;#160;</comText>

Regardless of the tier of accessibility survey selected by the user, the accessibility 
survey report should include opinions of probable costs to remedy each existing item of 
noncompliance, as identified within the scope of the tier selected, if the item is feasible 
and practical to implement with respect to considering physical constraints. 
Nonetheless, noncompliant items identified by the consultant should be reported. &lt;br /&gt;

This guide also recognizes that the nature of many accessibility improvements may 
require services &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;beyond the scope of this guide &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;such as the preparation of design 
studies, exploratory probing and discovery, detailed measurements, and space 
planning/alteration studies to determine the feasibility, efficacy, and appropriate cost to 
implement such improvements.</comText>

		<comText>The Americans with Disabilities Act is a civil rights law that was enacted in 1990 to 
provide persons with disabilities with accommodations and access equal to, or similar 
to, that available to the general public. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title III of the ADA requires that owners of 
buildings that are considered to be places of public accommodations remove 
those architectural barriers and communications barriers that are considered 
readily achievable in accordance with the resources available to building 
ownership to allow use of the facility by the disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The obligation to remove 
barriers where readily achievable is an ongoing one. The determination as to whether 
removal of a barrier or an implementation of a component or system is readily achievable 
is often a business decision, which is based on the resources available to the owner or 
tenants, and contingent upon the timing of implementation as well. Determination of 
whether barrier removal is readily achievable is on a case-by-case basis; the United 
States Department of Justice did not provide numerical formulas or thresholds of any 
kind to determine whether an action is readily achievable.&amp;#160;

		<comText>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Definitions of Terms Specific to Understanding the Americans with Disabilities 
Act:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Alteration:&lt;/u&gt; a change to a building or facility made by, on behalf of, or for the use of a 
public accommodation or commercial facility, that affects or could affect the usability of 
the building or facility or part thereof. Alterations include, but are not limited to, 
remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation,reconstruction, historic restoration, change or 
rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the 
plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, 
painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not 
alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility. An alteration to a 
place of public accommodation or a commercial facility shall comply with the ADA 
guidelines for new construction and alterations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Architectural barriers:&lt;/u&gt; a physical object that impedes a disabled person&amp;rsquo;s access to, or 
use of, a facility. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Commercial facility:&lt;/u&gt; a facility intended for nonresidential use by private entities and their 
employees only and whose operations affect commerce such as single-tenant office 
buildings, factories, warehouses, etc. A commercial facility may contain areas of both 
public accommodations and nonpublic accommodations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Communication barriers:&lt;/u&gt; a part of a building system intended to communicate to the 
public and which, due to its design or construction, fails to meet the communications 
needs of a disabled person. Taken together with architectural barriers, they are often 
referred to as physical barriers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Public accommodation:&lt;/u&gt; facilities operated by private entities offering goods and services 
to the public, for example multi-tenanted office buildings, places of lodging, restaurants 
and bars, theaters, auditoriums, retail, service establishments, terminals for public 
transportation, place of public display or collection, places of recreation, social services 
centers, apartment leasing offices, educational centers, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Readily achievable:&lt;/u&gt; defined by the ADA as an action that is &amp;ldquo;easily accomplishable and 
able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Presentation of Opinions of Probable Costs:&lt;/u&gt; Regardless of the tier of accessibility survey 
selected by the user, the accessibility survey report should include opinions of probable 
costs to remedy each existing item of noncompliance, as identified within the scope of 
the tier selected, if the item is feasible and practical to implement with respect to 
considering physical constraints. Nonetheless, noncompliant items identified by the 
consultant should be reported. The opinions of probable costs to remedy ADA 
deficiencies should be identified separately and not combined with other physical 
deficiencies identified with a building system, to the extent reasonable.</comText>

		<comText>Your water heater serves not only to provide domestic hot water (i.e. bathing, dishes, cooking etc.) but also provides the heat for the building (Hydronic). Hydronic water heaters have a higher BTU or ability to heat water hotter than a"Standard" water heater. However your water heater is a "Standard" water heater modified to also heat your building. This means that some Heating Contractors or Public Service Gas companies may differ on opinion as to whether or not this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the building. Because this Standard water heater has been in place for sometime, one can infer that if it was not adequately heating the building, the previous owners more than likely would have replaced it with a "Hydronic" water heater. I am unable to determine if this "Standard" water heater will adequately heat the building and recommend you obtain a second opinion.</comText>

		<comText>Aluminum wire is installed on 120 VAC branch electrical circuits in the subject house. These single strand, branch circuit aluminum wires were used widely in houses during the mid 1960s and 1970s. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, problems due to expansion can cause overheating at connections between the wire and devices (switches and outlets) or at splices, which has resulted in fires. For further information on aluminum wiring contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission via the Internet at &lt;A href="http://www.cpsc.gov/"&gt;http://www.cpsc.gov/&lt;/A&gt; . It is recommended that the electrical system be evaluated by a licensed electrician.</comText>

		<comText>Your heat system is hydronic forced air which uses the hot water from water heater in order to make heat. In severe cold temperatures, you may need to turn temperature setting up on water heater. This will also cause tap water at faucets to become hot. A mixing valve is then used to add cold water to the hot tap water. Your mixing valve is a black knob with a red top that you turn clockwise to add cold water to the hot. It is located *LOCATION(plumbing/mix-valve)*. This knob is only needed during frigid temperatures requiring a hotter heat at registers. FYI</comText>

		<comText>Clay liners that once were used with oil furnaces, and are now being used for venting gas or propane furnaces or water heaters may deteriorate called "Spalling."

It is common that homes of any age will have had repairs performed and some repairs may not be in a workmanlike manner. Some areas may appear less than standard. This inspection looks for items that are not functioning as intended. It does not grade the repair. It is common to see old plumbing or mixed materials. Sometimes water signs in crawlspaces or basements could be years old from a problem that no longer exists. Or, it may still need further attention and repair. Determining this can be difficult on an older building. Sometimes in older homes there are signs of damage to wood from wood eating insects. Having this is typical and fairly common. If the building inspection reveals signs of damage you should have a pest control company inspect further for activity and possible hidden damage.

The inspection of main components is the purpose of this inspection. Components such as structure, roof, plumbing, heating and electrical are main components. Utilities must be on for inspection of these areas. If the inspection report states that a utility is off (no water, no fuel, or no electrical) then any item relating to these components cannot be inspected. Always consider having the utility on in order to inspect these areas. There is a fee for a return trip to re-inspect.</comText>

		<comName>white efflorescence</comName>
		<comText>White efflorescence (powder substance) on block wall indicates moisture is in contact with the masonry. This does not necessarily indicate that intrusion will occur. I recommend checking the gutters and the downspout drain lines for proper operation. Also, a water proofing paint could be applied to the interior side of the block if necessary. Efflorescence is found on many homes without water intrusion occurring inside the building. But, it should alert you to the possibility that future steps may be needed.</comText>

		<comText>Your water heater does not have a "Thermal Expansion tank" installed to prevent a possible leak at the T&amp;amp;P or "pop-off" valve. Recent changes in code require one when a new water heater is installed. This change is not retroactive on older previously installed Gas/LP water heaters such as yours. There were no leaks or drips at the T&amp;amp;P valve during inspection. If your water heater does begin to drip or leak, then a thermal expansion tank may be needed.</comText>

		<iiText>ROOF STRUCTURE AND ATTIC (If the attic is inaccessible, report the method used to inspect)</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Take your time and trace out the rafters with your light. Move around in all areas accessible. The area you don't check, is the area you missed something. Don't miss anything. It pays to have a good flashlight and a back up. Always note fire damage in the attic.  And do a stab test to determine the strength of a charred area. Sometimes the"Char" is only skin deep and it looks worse than it is. If you think it's strong, say so. If not, then recommend repairs. Sags can occur where a plywood clip is missing, you have a damaged truss or rafters spaced a little too far apart or you have a bad crown in wood. Or possibly a weak piece of plywood. Undersized wood such as a "2 x 4" rafter spanned too far can create sag. A knee wall or reinforcement would be suggested. This is also a good time to spot wet signs on insulation to alert you of a possible leak. Also scan for wiring splices and exhaust fan ventilation and clearance of insulation around recessed "can" lights. To get the R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply thickness in inches by 3.142857. For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. Or better yet, use the"AUTO COMMENTS." Insulation usually comes in four Types: Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand, Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock, Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals. Rigid Foam Board (used on the exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) is obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.</iiHelp>

		<iiText>SERVICE ENTRANCE AND PANELS</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Circuit breaker brand should match the panel brand. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their own circuit brand only, or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS. WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company. Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard. General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label. When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on panel states that no other brand is allowed. The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in form of litigation. Whether they do or don 't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it. There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself. Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground. Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers wouldn't do it.</iiHelp>

		<iiHelp>Use this question for miscellaneous electrical items found (i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc). GFCI OUTLETS: I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It of course identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct. Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not"Trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit. A Non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach to a metal rod or metal plumbing pipe. Or replace three-prong non-grounded outlet with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded. Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel. You can "Trip" a Non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil). Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at end of plug when outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, The two lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity," it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a ground wire. Another tip is "Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "Trips," doesn't mean it "Killed the circuit." It could be defective.  New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective. Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet. HOMEOWNERS frequently use a Freezer in their garage. And most outlets in garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, DON'T FORGET TO RE-SET THE GFCI OUTLET, OR YOU MAY BE BUYING THEIR SPOILED FOOD!</iiHelp>

Meanwhile, check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). An irratic movement of damper lid and soot build-up should be noted. Furnace should run for at least 15 minutes. It's a good technique to observe the firing or ignition of furnace. To do this, use the cut-off switch before you set thermostat to turn on furnace. If it's not running normal, recommend a licensed heat contractor service and repair as needed. Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer. ( GAS FURNACES ) use a gas tracer around unit. Examine burners and raceway for charred bits and recommend service if bits are excessive or flame is not even. If flame dances sharply or rolls under burner recommend service. Heat exchangers or the steel liner is more likely to crack near the pilot light.

If over 15 years old and operating good should still be noted as old, and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. When in doubt, recommend a licensed heat contractor to inspect further. ( BOILERS ) should be tested for 30 to 45 minutes to allow all radiators to heat fully. Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well should still be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation. Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes. Examine the vent pipe and where it enters chimney for integrity and proper seal. Check for back drafting by using a lighter or match around joints in vent pipe, or at an existing test hole (if any). Steam boilers have a sight glass to check water level. Circulating boilers do not have a sight glass. Boilers should be flushed regularly as part of a normal maintenance schedule. ( HEAT PUMPS ) should not be ran in AC mode if temp outside is @ 60 degrees or less. You could damage the unit. Be sure and note if you did not inspect it. Just because you have heat coming out the registers doesn't mean your compressor outside is working. The fan outside should be moving. And grab the suction line before it enters air handler inside and feel for heat. In summer, hand check the suction line for ice cold. No cold feeling means recommending service. The coils inside air handler may need cleaning or the liquid line may need refrigerant. Only trouble shooting by a qualified heat contractor can determine exactly. ( ELECTRIC BASE ) should be turned on and checked for proper operation, securely fastened to wall or floor. There should never be an outlet on wall directly above electric base. Remove front cover on baseboard and inspect the wire that runs the length of base located inside a tube. This wire can become brittle or weak over time, and cause abnormal heating up of unit and can cause a fire.</iiHelp>

To check for ambient air, you would need the A/C to run longer than 15 minutes or so. Insert a thermometer in the supply plenum, and then insert another thermometer into the return-air plenum. The Return air should be within 20-25 degrees of the thermometer in the supply plenum. The amount of time the A/C would need to run before checking ambient air will vary, depending upon how hot it is inside when you first ran the A/C.

Older homes were spaced about 8 feet. The floor joist should have a proper support at each end. If there are some homemade supports in the middle of some joists, (usually found in older homes), you need to consider why they are there:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is there something heavy above the floor like a piano or heavy furniture?&lt;LI&gt;Are the floor joists undersized or is the span too far and beginning to sag?&lt;LI&gt;Is there a bounce in the floor above?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Floor joists are not supposed to need any support between the two ends. Theoretically, you should be able to remove those temporary supports. Ask yourself if you would? Or what problem would result? That's how I determine if these temporary supports are really needed. If they are, then they need to have a proper support and footing. Usually a properly installed drop girder that supports several joists at one time is recommended.

		<iiHelp>Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing. Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of building) or possible leak at liner. Rust along bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heat elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet. Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level. Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground. When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU. See Discoveries and Auto Comments. Gas water heaters should be cranked up to come on and test draw at diverter with a match. If draw does not suck out flame on match, there could be a venting problem. White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in gas when not venting properly. A greasy residue on top of gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;I don't get up on all roofs, but many if not most of the roofs I see are accessible.  These are walkable roofs and not too steep. 
&lt;LI&gt; Hair-line cracks that sometimes occur on shingles cannot be seen unless you go up on the roof. Caulking or repair signs can be missed as well. If you're on the roof, look for boot flange for vent pipes to see if they fit the pipe to keep out rain. 
&lt;LI&gt;I don't walk on tile roofs or wood shakes for fear of damaging them or falling. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never step out on a metal awning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

		<iiHelp>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Quick Check:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there a lack of or improper flashing at wall junctions or chimneys?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does dormer siding have sufficient clearance from the roof?  Is it flashed properly?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Flashings are hidden most of the time, but you can go to the roof and wall junctions and tap on the shingle to see if it flexes away from the flashing underneath. 
&lt;LI&gt;Know what step flashing is, along with cap or counter flashing. The cap or counter flashing provides a hood over the step flashing and is bent and inserted into a masonry cut groove in brick or block. Flashing a rock chimney after a roof tear off is near impossible to do properly because you can't cut a groove in rock to tuck in bent flashing. The cap flashing is then laid flush and caulked at top, often failing in a short period of time. 
&lt;LI&gt;There is a product called Peel-n-Seal that is a foil backed sheet of tar and is pliable. It comes in a roll that can be cut with a knife and after peeling off wax paper can be molded to fit and seal against uneven surfaces like rock or stone. Some guys heat up the tar backing first with a butane torch for immediate sealing, depending on outside temperatures. This doesn't look as good as copper, but is a lot better than not installing proper cap or counter flashing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

It is impossible to look at a skylight installation and know if it will leak or not. Even when it looks perfect.&lt;LI&gt;Homes that have had a pressure washing company spray onto skylights can blow away, or push sealant caulking away, and cause leaks. You can't know what has happened since the skylight has been installed.&lt;LI&gt;Look for fresh paint inside at the skylight chase or tell-tale water marks that may only be condensation and not leaks.&lt;LI&gt;Vaulted ceilings with skylights can cause condensation in summer, if the ceiling air gets hot enough and an AC vent is mixing with hot ceiling air. Water droplets (or stains) can form on the ceiling. Sometimes it is difficult to determine which one is occurring in the building.&lt;LI&gt;Chimneys: Look for loose mortar above the roof line.&lt;LI&gt;Check the cement crown for cracks.&lt;LI&gt;White efflorescence or flaking of brick (spalling) indicates moisture is soaking into the brick somewhere.&lt;LI&gt;Do not try to remove metal hood bonnets on chimney to inspect liner. They sometimes are difficult to get back on or have been semi-permanently glued requiring a lot of work each time it is removed.&lt;LI&gt;Wood siding chimneys can deteriorate if metal hood does not completely cover outside corner boards.&lt;LI&gt;Stucco peeling away from the surface it is bonded to, is generally caused from moisture or a previously painted sub surface (painted masonry block that stucco is applied on).&lt;LI&gt; Brick divider walls separating flues are still found on many old homes. Loose or missing brick in these divider walls calls for a certified chimney sweep to inspect further.&lt;LI&gt; Roof penetrations: Know how to flash a chimney, install a vent pipe or vent fan hood flange into the weave of shingles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

While it is impossible for the inspector to check for that without repairing the loose gutter, the buyer should be made aware of the possibility that the gutters are loose because of possible deterioration.

They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes.

According to one manufacturer, newly installed plastic or vinyl windows need to be locked for long periods of time in order for the vinyl to stretch or conform. If left unlocked it can be difficult to line up and lock.&lt;LI&gt;Something else to be alert for when inspecting windows in New Construction is looking for windows that were installed in too wide of an opening.

Does the spray nozzle leak or drip above or below the sink when faucet is turned on? Is the aerator working?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. Does the plumbing system pass the functional flow test? (Run a shower at bathing temperature and then turn on the sink faucets and flush the toilet.

Did you check the floor on each side of toilet with your weight?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;10. Lift the toilet tank lid and inspect water quality (iron or sediment). Some sellers will attempt to clean or hide iron problems before the inspection but they forget about cleaning inside the toilet tank&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(Shower or bathtubs)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;11.

Are the hot and cold faucets reversed?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;13. Are any bathtubs missing a shower?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;14. Are there any corroded galvanized supply lines? Wet joints?  Are they supported ok?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;15. Old concrete sinks need to be partially filled to check for leaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;16. Check for poly piping and use auto-comment if poly is present&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;17. Indicate whether or not the jet powered tub worked properly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to check in several areas throughout your inspection on the type of water supply or distribution materials in the building. Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If the water heater is in the crawlspace or basement, it should not be lower than ground level. You may not dig a hole to set the water heater in.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Use a lighter at the draft hood when the gas water heater is on to check for proper draw.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6.  A gas water heater in the closet needs fresh air from the attic at the ceiling and near the floor.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inspect the plumbing connections and tank housing.&lt;LI&gt;Note rust signs from moisture or condensation (if in a damp area of building) or possible leak at the liner.&lt;LI&gt;Rust along the bottom can be caused when water leaks out while changing heating elements. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the building has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant building and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If all the water is not removed, then the pump is not adequate and more corrective action is needed.&lt;LI&gt;When recommending a sump pump be installed, you should think about trenches around the perimeter with gravel installed leading to the lowest area and a way to exit water from building without using the sewer system, so our taxpayer dollars don't treat the rain water.&lt;LI&gt;Think about electricity which usually requires an electrician to install a GFCI outlet within reach of the sump pump cord (no extension cords).&lt;LI&gt; Don't forget the plastic vapor barrier. If all that makes sense then it may solve a water problem.  Another problem to look for is an approved sump pump container, not a bucket. What's the difference? A lot of difference, if a water infiltration expert comes behind you slinging mud. A bucket with a few drain holes in the bottom should work - but I would reference in my report that the bucket while appears to work fine is not an approved sump pump container as some repair specialist may note.&lt;LI&gt;Don't forget to raise the rod and float to see if it actually works.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but not new construction. The problem occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic or PVC, which removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make sure the electric panel is grounded.&lt;LI&gt; Some electricians say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a ground. I have heard some electricians disagree and say that there is always a way to ground the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that "there is only one ground wire found on the panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed to non-metal and there is no ground". Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the panel. I recommend an electrician add another ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS.&lt;LI&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company.&lt;LI&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard.&lt;LI&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label.&lt;LI&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later it was found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the panel states that no other brand is allowed.&lt;LI&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the form of litigation. Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it.&lt;LI&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself.&lt;LI&gt;Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground.&lt;LI&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electricians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Until you learn when to recommend an electrician, you can explain to the buyer that this wiring method at the panel looks unfamiliar and you want to hold off on your condition call until you speak to an electrician. Then call the electrician and ask him. If possible, email him a picture of it if there is enough time allowed. This is how you learn. Pass all panels that appear to be wired properly based on what is proper, and recommend an electrician on everything else.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

To do this, use the cut-off switch at the furnace before you set the thermostat to turn the furnace on. If it's not running normally, recommend a licensed heat contractor for service and repair as needed.&lt;LI&gt;Learn how to perform a smoke bomb test. Use a Gas Tracer.&lt;LI&gt;( GAS FURNACES ) Use a gas tracer around the unit.

Some radiators that are old may take longer to heat but you have to decide while your there if they heat from one end to the other. This time is needed to allow pressure to build and check for leaks. Radiators are extremely expensive and you don't want to miss even one. If over 15 years old and operating well it should be noted as old and recommend servicing annually to monitor for safe operation.&lt;LI&gt;Check around the sight hole for smoke stains around the collar that may be leaking fumes.

If not, make sure there is more than nails supporting the band to the post. A general rule to attach deck band to building is to use 5/8" galvanized carriage bolts with washers at each end and every 36 inches or so in between.

Fire can burn at 2000 degrees and a metal liner for a fireplace that has had a chimney fire, or became to hot, will have a rainbow color outside above the roof on the shiny metal vent pipe. The metal liner is safe for one chimney fire but not two. If you see this rainbow color, I would recommend a chimney sweep inspect it to determine if a chimney fire occurred and if this liner is safe to use.&lt;LI&gt;Woodstove inserts must have a flue connector that connects the insert to its liner. If not, creosote can collect on top of the insert (a wheel barrow load) and cause a chimney fire that can destroy a brick chimney - if not the building.

Ambient air test is when you stick two meat thermometers into the main plenum of the air handler. One in the return air and one in the supply. Preferably near each other at the main trunk. If the AC has been running for an adequate amount of time before test you should see a range somewhere between 14 and 22 degrees. The supply should be the colder of the two. This test is not conclusive because of varying conditions but if it's out of range and the AC has had time to cool the building, then you can recommend an HVAC person (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Is there any loose, missing or hanging insulation?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Are there standing water stains on the plastic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. Mold or Fungi on joists indicates a moisture problem and moisture should be noted in your report. Whether or not you use the word mold, fungi, wood destroying organisms or mildew is up to you. The word mildew is used to describe the type of fungi that can only grow on fruit. Mildew should not be used in a inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;7. Note the absence (or condition) of the firewall separation in a crawlspace or basement, when the building is a multi-family dwelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Look for an undercut foundation where someone might have dug below the original footing to create a basement. Sometimes they stucco the dirt wall with cement which is brittle and is not adequate. Also look for support piers where dirt was dug away around the footing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;9. Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a building is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Floor spaces:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A vapor barrier is a roll of plastic (6 mil thick preferred) that is spread out over the crawlspace to keep moisture from entering the crawlspace from the ground. It is essential and inexpensive compared to its prevention abilities.&lt;/P&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.

Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Make a note if the only connection for dryer is gas. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note if both are available, as a plus. 
&lt;LI&gt;Try to inspect the vent pipe for exhaust fans in the attic to see if they terminate outside.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Newer homes note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. Workmanship is important on all homes but especially new ones. Look for signs of only one coat of paint or poor sanding, nail indentations etc. Look at perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tear or blemish etc.</iiHelp>

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A rough guess of R value in the attic is determined by the thickness of insulation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;about 6 inches thick or just under 22 R value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 7 inches thick or 25.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 8 inches thick or just over 29 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 9 inches thick or just under 33 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 10 inches thick or just over 36.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 11 inches thick or just over 40 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 12 inches thick or just under 44 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 13 inches thick or 47.6 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 14 inches thick or just at 51 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 15 inches thick or just under 55 R-value 
&lt;LI&gt;about 16 inches thick or 58 R-value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage.

Look for water stains on table legs, shelving and the bottom of the stair stringer for indications of water intrusion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;More Info:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Foundation cracks:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hair-line cracks are generally okay as long as there aren't many or if they are old. Usually, all settlement cracks occur within the first three years after a building is built. Most of the time you are looking at an old crack. To help eliminate concerns about a crack ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are there any water intrusion signs?&lt;LI&gt;Are there cracks on the other remaining walls?&lt;LI&gt;If a wall is painted, is there paint in the crack as old as the paint on the wall? No paint in crack could mean a fresh crack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stair-step crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is usually the least significant. A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;vertical crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; is a little more concerning but not as bad as a&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal crack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;A&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; horizontal crack&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; with a dirt bank on the other side of the wall is the worse type of crack. You can take a straight edge (sometimes the seller has a board in his basement) and hold it vertical against the cracked wall. There will be a gap between the straight edge and the block that gives you an idea of how much the wall has moved because of the load behind it.  A 1/4 inch gap or bigger in the crack raises a concern as well. On the other hand, there are plenty of homes with hairline cracks and they are generally fine. You need to consider when to ask for a structural engineer and when to say they are typical settlement cracks. Moisture on a wall can also increase the likelihood of further settlement. This opinion is based on my experience living in the Southeast US. When in doubt, recommend an engineer. It would be cheaper for you to be embarrassed and pay $300 for an engineer's wasted trip (worse case scenario), than to be wrong about the severity of settlement and be sued for thousands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always check the basement or crawlspace last (after you run water from all fixtures inside) to find leaks. When you do enter the crawlspace:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;look at each inside wall to the left and right of the entryway for water or mud marks on wall.&lt;LI&gt;If the basement entry is below grade with steps, check to see if a floor drain exists and does it appear to work properly.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion signs are found along the foundation wall as a water line or stain.&lt;LI&gt;Silt travel on plastic or ground should be mentioned.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes stains are seen under a foundation vent on wall.&lt;LI&gt;Water intrusion throws up a red alert to as to whether or not mold is growing.&lt;LI&gt;Sump pumps don't always remove all the water. Or all the water doesn't always travel to the sump pump.&lt;LI&gt;In the basement, look for water stains on walls or wooden legs of a shelf or work table.&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes water seeps in through the wall or pin holes.&lt;LI&gt;Old brick foundation walls have a hard time keeping the water out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a general rule, you should try your best to include a comment about water intrusion or signs. Each inspection, see if you can discover any type of silt or dirt stains on block wall or support piers. Include new construction where you are confident that the stains are likely from before the roof was installed and rain water fell into the inside of foundation walls. All stains should be mentioned in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building Inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt; structural components including foundations, floors, walls, columns or piers, ceilings and roof.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. The clothes dryer must vent to outside air. Note if there is a lint trap kit installed instead of venting to the outside air.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. A gas powered dryer should not use a vinyl ventpipe.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. A bathroom needs a window or a vent fan.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Almost everyone expects an electric 220-volt connection for the Dryer. 
&lt;LI&gt;Make a note if the only connection for dryer is gas. 
&lt;LI&gt;Note if both are available, as a plus. 
&lt;LI&gt;Try to inspect the vent pipe for exhaust fans in the attic to see if they terminate outside.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed. Great time to take a picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Rusted metal waste lines can sometimes collapse or fail upon touching them during inspection.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;1. Is there any staining or discoloration that warrants a finger pressure test on exterior door trim /jambs at bottom ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;2. Does the garage door opening height and width seem normal?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;3. The garage door must reverse when met with resistance regardless of whether or not they have sensors. Sensors should be no higher off the floor than 6" or according to manufacturer specs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;4. What is the condition of the weather-stripping at garage door floor and sides?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;5. Check both sides of Garage door for damage?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;6. The "jerk and let go" test for the garage door works best but there is a risk of damaging the door if you don't let go quick enough. A 2 x 4 block placed on floor can damage a metal door if door does not reverse (not recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;8. Note older garage door springs that do not have retention cables to contain the spring if the cable breaks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always open and shut a door from both sides and note whether or not the door latches. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also note if the door is out of square enough that it no longer ensures privacy. 
&lt;LI&gt; Check for holes in doors and for a doorstop on each one. Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors). 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted. Look at the ground in front of the door for negative slope that may allow water intrusion. 
&lt;LI&gt;Check to see if the door is delaminating or deteriorated at the bottom . 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sliding glass and patio doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Open and close doors as needed and check for "daylight" and continuous weather-stripping. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also, close the door with knob until it latches. Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit. 
&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not. 
&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive. 
&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance. Adjustment screws are usually found on the side and rear of opener. These door adjustment screws can be tricky to adjust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Note any trim or hardware missing (check all doors).&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basement or Crawlspace:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Make sure that the door fits properly and is properly painted.

Then turn deadbolt and check strike for proper alignment and a tight fit.&lt;LI&gt;Also look carefully at the glass, and check for "Cloudy" appearance or cracked glass. This is a good time to inspect the floor area around door for possible water intrusion or deterioration.&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Garage doors:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Raise the garage door and lay a 2 x 4 block on the floor at the middle of the door opening (except a metal door that could be damaged by a 2 x 4 block). Document if the door reverses or not.&lt;LI&gt;If you use your hand to provide resistance and the door does not reverse, you can severely damage the door if you're not careful. The door can "fold-up" damaging the door panel and chain drive.&lt;LI&gt;Even if the door has electronic sensors, it still should reverse when met with resistance.

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the building has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant building and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;Look at an old building with an old eye. 
&lt;LI&gt;Always note water stains. 
&lt;LI&gt;On newer homes, note nail pops, exposed or loose sheetrock tape and repair signs. 
&lt;LI&gt;Workmanship is important in all homes but especially new ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look for signs of only one coat of paint, poor sanding, nail indentations etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Look at the perimeter of floor for water stains or deterioration. 
&lt;LI&gt;Bounce around a little on the floor (without lifting your feet). 
&lt;LI&gt;Note any areas damaged on floor covering, including stains, exposed seams, small tears or blemishes etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Sometimes there are several in one building.&lt;LI&gt;Poly piping has become a concern. The real negative is that some people believe that it is not "if" but "when" the poly will fail. It is estimated that poly will fail within 15 years of installation. Whether this is true or not, it is important for you to know that someone may say that in court for the plaintiff and you might be the defendant. Keep that in mind.&lt;LI&gt;Pex material comes in colors and replaces poly as far as flexibility in installation.&lt;LI&gt;CPVC is easy to install but freeze breaks can split CPVC&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;causing significant damage. Instead of a small split in the pipe like will happen with copper, CPVC can take out many feet if not all the exposed piping that froze.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copper seems to be the tried and true choice.&lt;LI&gt;Toilet tanks can tell a lot.  I have had sellers with iron problems clean all the brown from all fixtures before inspection and then lift the tank lid and see what they missed.

If the washing machine drain line is 1 1/2 inch (older), instead of 2 inch then note the possibility that  newer washing machines may overflow a smaller drain (2 inch diameter recommended).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure the waste line for plumbing has a trap and vent.&lt;LI&gt;Many older homes still have a 1 1/2" diameter waste line and new washing machines have stronger pumps that may overflow the drain. Not all but some. Look for signs on the wall or floor, or the drain hose may have been modified in some way.&lt;LI&gt;"Gray water" is a term that means that the water drains into the yard and not the sewer or septic system. This could be a violation in your area. Consult with the health department or building safety department on this issue.&lt;LI&gt;Some septic tanks were not designed for the volume of water from a washing machine and could clog if gray water was connected to it. If you discover gray water use, note the possibilities.&lt;LI&gt;The outlet for the washing machine should be grounded.  A repair would be to install a GFCI outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Old cast iron waste lines often ooze a leak at pipe connections because the old seals in between pipe connections are deteriorating. It will still work but may need repair. Plumbers who repair these old pipes do not like to repair only one connection, because working on these old pipes can cause other joint connections nearby to fail (hammering, vibration etc.).  They will sometimes explain the cost and that it usually includes a larger section for replacement.&lt;LI&gt;The crud that builds up on the inside of these pipes is surprising. That's why sometimes a building plumbing system could work fine until left vacant for 3 -6 months and then the crud inside the pipes begin to dry and fall down and clog pipes. Same is true for old galvanized supply lines when left vacant for long periods. Not always the case but more often than you would think.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The building inspector shall observe&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Interior water supply and distribution system, including: piping materials, supports, and insulation; fixtures and faucets; functional flow; leaks; and cross connections; Interior drain, waste, and vent system, including: traps; drain, waste, and vent piping; piping supports and pipe insulation; leaks; and functional drainage; Hot water systems including: water heating equipment; normal operating controls; automatic safety controls; and chimneys, flues, and vents; Fuel storage and distribution systems including: interior fuel storage equipment, supply piping, venting, and supports; leaks; and Sump pumps.

(i.e. loose splices, boxes missing cover plates etc).&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI.  It should still trip by pressing the test button on the outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire.&lt;LI&gt; Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets that are installed can be defective.&lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building, don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</iiHelp>

A ground wire is the wire outside that goes from the meterbase to the ground rod. In some rural areas or abroad, a bond wire to the metal plumbing is acceptable as the only ground with no ground wire outside. This is on some older homes but not new construction. The problem occurs when the plumber removes the old galvanized metal plumbing and replaces it with plastic or PVC, which removes the only bond/ground wire. We can't depend on the plumber to make sure the electric panel is grounded.&lt;LI&gt; Some electricians say that on some old glass globe meter bases that there is nowhere to put a ground. I have heard some electricians disagree and say that there is always a way to ground the meterbase. So sometimes I write in the report when I see this situation that "there is only one ground wire found on the panel and it leads to a metal plumbing pipe that has been changed to non-metal and there is no ground". Or that it goes to a an older galvanized line that may get changed in the future by a plumber and disconnect the only ground for the panel. I recommend an electrician add another ground wire.&lt;LI&gt;Circuit breaker brand should match the panel. An electrician may point this out to your buyer after they purchase the building. I never used to care about mixed brands as long as they fit properly. But clearly on the label, each panel brand requires their circuit brand only or it will void the UL listing. This was enough to scare my buyer, and I decided that I would not buy any more breakers. Since then, I've discovered that some electricians feel that some brands can mix because of companies merging. I disagree unless those names are also on that particular panel label. SIEMENS, ITE and GOULD supposedly are one company. MURRAY may also be a part of SIEMENS.&lt;LI&gt;WESTINGHOUSE, BRYANT AND CUTLER-HAMMER are supposedly one company.&lt;LI&gt;Remember: The electrical panel has a label on it. And somewhere it usually states that only their brand is allowed to be used. All other brands will void warranty or may be a hazard.&lt;LI&gt;General Switch Brand panel may allow other brands that will fit. If they do, they will indicate it on the label.&lt;LI&gt;When in doubt, recommend an electrician. If a fire was to occur and later it was found that the source was from the panel and it had different breakers, the homeowner would not be denied the insurance claim. But, the insurance company may feel that the recent inspection should have revealed it. Especially when a UL label on the panel states that no other brand is allowed.&lt;LI&gt;The insurance company may seek compensation from the inspector in the form of litigation. Whether they do or don't, right is right and wrong is wrong, so I mention it.&lt;LI&gt;There should also be a ground wire attached to a driven ground rod at the meter base. This grounds the panel itself.&lt;LI&gt;Some local electricians may say that one is really good enough (at plumbing or meter base). But that's true only if the supply lines are not metal (Pex, CPVC etc.). If only the metal plumbing has a ground and not the meter base, and the metal plumbing is old corroded galvanized piping that gets replaced with Pex, there would then be no ground.&lt;LI&gt;Or, if the plumber replaced the old piping with copper or metal, it would be up to him to reset the ground and clamp onto the new pipe. And we all know plumbers aren't electricians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;LI&gt;To get R-Value for Fiberglass, Rock Wool and Mineral Fiber, multiply the thickness in inches by 3.142857. 
&lt;LI&gt;For Cellulose, multiply inches by 3.6666 to find R-Value. 
&lt;LI&gt;Insulation usually comes in four types:  Loose-fill, Batts, Rolls and Rigid Foam Board. 
&lt;LI&gt;Fiberglass is recycled glass and sand 
&lt;LI&gt;Rock Wool is recycled Steel scraps and Basaltic Rock 
&lt;LI&gt;Cellulose is recycled newspapers treated with fire retardant chemicals (Borax). 
&lt;LI&gt;Rigid Foam Board (used on exterior side of walls and behind the ceiling panel of a Cathedral ceiling) obviously not visible or accessible during an inspection. 
&lt;LI&gt;A building can lose 50% of it's heat through the roof, with 25% going through the walls and windows, and 25% through the floor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

Two prong plugs in the Garage or around any areas with water?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;More Info:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I use a simple three-prong plug with a GFCI test button. It identifies whether or not the outlet is grounded, and if the polarity is correct.&lt;LI&gt;Some tips are: Your three-prong GFCI test plug will not "trip" the outlet if it is a non-grounded GFCI. But it still should trip by pressing the test button on outlet, and kill the circuit.&lt;LI&gt;A non-grounded outlet can be corrected by either attaching a ground wire to the outlet and attach it to a metal rod or a metal plumbing pipe.&lt;LI&gt;Or, replace the three-prong&lt;EM&gt;non-grounded outlet&lt;/EM&gt; with a three-prong GFCI outlet. A sticker should be on the outlet that identifies it as non-grounded.&lt;LI&gt;Or last, change the circuit breaker to a GFCI breaker at the panel.&lt;LI&gt;You can "trip" a non-grounded GFCI with a voltmeter by placing one prong of the voltmeter in the short slit of the outlet, and take the other prong of the voltmeter and touch a metal plumbing pipe (that eventually contacts the soil).&lt;LI&gt;Most three-prong GFCI plugs will show two lights at the end of the plug when the outlet being tested is grounded. When you press the button on the plug, both lights should remain lit and strong. If however, the plug lights up only one of the two grounding lights "Faint or Dim" and you press the button on the plug and it shows "Reverse polarity", it may just be a "loose" ground wire and can be corrected a lot easier than having to install a new ground wire. &lt;LI&gt;Just because you can press the test button on the GFCI outlet using your finger and it "trips," doesn't mean it killed the circuit. It could be defective.&lt;LI&gt;New GFCI outlets can be defective when installed.  &lt;LI&gt;Always use the three-prong GFCI test plug on every three-prong outlet.&lt;LI&gt;Homeowners frequently use a freezer in their garage. Most outlets in the garage are on a GFCI Circuit. When you're inspecting the building don't forget to reset the GFCI outlet or you may be buying the homeowners spoiled food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish. If you discover rust along the bottom, then remove panel access and feel the insulation to determine if it's currently wet.&lt;LI&gt;Water heaters installed in a crawlspace should not be below ground level.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters installed in a garage should be at least 18 inches off the ground.&lt;LI&gt;When two gas vent pipes enter the chimney together, the highest BTU should enter chimney under the smaller BTU.&lt;LI&gt;Gas water heaters should have the thermostat turned up to force it to come on in order to test the draw at the diverter with a match or lighter. If the draw does not noticeably suck in flame on a match, there could be a venting problem.&lt;LI&gt;White deposits and rust on metal vent pipe can occur from moisture in the gas when not venting properly.&lt;LI&gt;A greasy residue on top of the gas water heater is also a sign of a vent problem.&lt;LI&gt;A blackened or smoky appearance on and around the housing near the flame of a gas water heater indicates the need for more air (combustion air).&lt;LI&gt;The T&amp;amp;P valve (Test and Pressure or Pop off valve) can look fine if the building has not had the water heater on 24 hours before inspection. It can then leak after the buyer moves in. The primary reason is that pressure on the system builds up at night when no one is using water.  With gas, the added pressure is a result of steam. Be aware of this when you inspect a vacant building and the water heater has not been on for 24 hours prior.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Reference Materials:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</iiHelp>
